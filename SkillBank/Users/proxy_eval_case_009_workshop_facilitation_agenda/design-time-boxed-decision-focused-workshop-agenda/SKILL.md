# design-time-boxed-decision-focused-workshop-agenda

Designs workshop agendas that enforce time-boxed segments and mandatory, facilitator-led decision checkpoints with pre-defined fallback protocols to ensure concrete, accountable, and irreversible outcomes—not open-ended discussion.

## Prompt

# Goal
Design a workshop agenda with strictly time-boxed segments and explicit, irreversible decision checkpoints that produce observable, actionable, and trackable outputs (e.g., prioritized lists with owners and deadlines, signed agreements, ratified actions) — and include pre-defined fallback plans activated *only* when discussion diverges from the intended decision path.

# Constraints & Style
- Every segment must end with a ✅ Decision Checkpoint: a binary, observable, and recorded output (e.g., voted-on priority list, committed action with owner + deadline + dependency, signed pact, tagged root cause). Avoid ambiguous language like 'explore', 'discuss', or 'consider' in checkpoint definitions.
- No segment may exceed its allocated time; if overrun occurs, reduce the next segment’s time — never delay a decision checkpoint. Include facilitator enforcement notes (e.g., 'cut off at bell', 'vote to lock top 3', 'invoke tiebreaker rule').
- Exclude all open-ended brainstorming or ideation-only phases unless immediately followed by a convergence step with hard deadline, named owner, and closure mechanism.
- Outputs must be *actionable and trackable*: require named owners, dates, support asks, formal sign-offs, or verifiable ratification — no vague deliverables like 'shared understanding' or 'ideas generated'.
- Each segment must include one 🔄 Fallback Plan: a concrete, low-cognition intervention triggered *only* when discussion becomes unfocused, repetitive, or avoids commitment (e.g., 'facilitator declares top 3 using prep input', 'switch to silent dot-voting', 'read aloud pre-submitted answer'). No facilitator improvisation.
- Pre-work is required only if it directly feeds a decision checkpoint (e.g., submitting blockers 48h prior to enable voting and mapping).
- Agenda must specify max participant count and team composition rationale (e.g., '3–4 reps per key team') to preserve decision quality.
- All facilitation language must be neutral, present-tense, and behavior-anchored: prompts must elicit concrete facts, binary choices, ranked lists, named persons/dates/asks, or signed commitments — never open-ended questions or interpretive paraphrasing.
- At each decision checkpoint, state the required output format *before* discussion begins (e.g., 'We need exactly 3 blockers — each tagged with one root cause label. No explanations.').
- If participants introduce assumptions, root causes, or preferences, respond with a closed-loop clarifying prompt (e.g., 'To lock this in: Is the dependency *X from Y by Z*? Yes or no.') — not an invitation to expand.
- If ambiguity persists after one clarification attempt, invoke the pre-agreed tiebreaker (e.g., prep data, facilitator call, majority vote); no rephrasing or deferral.
- Output format: clean Markdown table with columns: Time, Segment & Purpose, Time-Box, ✅ Decision Checkpoint (Enforced Output), 🔄 Fallback Plan (Triggered if discussion diverges). Follow with a concise "Key Enforcement Mechanics" section listing timer rules, fallback triggers, consequence logic (e.g., 'if unratified by 1:10, facilitator selects top action from prep submissions'), and required facilitation language patterns (e.g., 'All prompts must be answerable with fact, binary, rank, name/date/ask, or signature').
