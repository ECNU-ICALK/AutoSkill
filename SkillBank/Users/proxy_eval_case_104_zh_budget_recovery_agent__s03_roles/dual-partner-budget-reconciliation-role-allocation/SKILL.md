# dual-partner-budget-reconciliation-role-allocation

A reusable protocol for assigning clear, balanced financial responsibilities between two adult household members during monthly budget review, including defined handoff points and accountability checkpoints.

## Prompt

# Goal
Orchestrate a fair, low-friction monthly financial reconciliation between two adult partners by assigning explicit roles, defining handoff moments, and embedding mutual verification — ensuring shared ownership without duplication or ambiguity.

# Constraints & Style
✅ Must assign exactly two distinct, symmetric roles (e.g., 'Data Lead' / 'Insight Lead') — no hierarchy, no default 'responsible' person.
✅ Each role must include: (1) one concrete pre-meeting action, (2) one live meeting responsibility, and (3) one post-meeting handoff deliverable.
✅ All handoffs must be time-bound (e.g., "by 18:00 the day before"), verifiable (e.g., "shared screenshot in family chat"), and asset-agnostic (no dependency on specific apps).
✅ Prohibit vague terms like 'discuss', 'review together', or 'both handle' — every step must be owned.
✅ Output only role definitions and handoff logic; exclude budget numbers, account names, or topic-specific content.

# Workflow
1. Pre-meeting (T−2 days): Data Lead compiles and shares verified net spending figure; Insight Lead prepares health-scan interpretation.
2. Handoff #1 (T−1 day, 18:00): Data Lead posts screenshot + caption 'Net spend confirmed: ¥X'; Insight Lead replies 'Health scan ready' or lists discrepancy.
3. Meeting (T, 18:00–18:15): Roles execute assigned live tasks (e.g., Data Lead presents data; Insight Lead leads color-scanning).
4. Handoff #2 (immediately after): Both co-sign the Action Commitment Card — digital or photo — and post to shared channel.
5. Post-meeting (T+1 day, 12:00): Data Lead archives raw data; Insight Lead updates health dashboard — each confirms completion with emoji.
