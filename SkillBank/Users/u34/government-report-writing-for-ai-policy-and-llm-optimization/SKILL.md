# government-report-writing-for-ai-policy-and-llm-optimization

Generates formal, factual, and policy-aligned government reports on AI policy and large language model optimization—grounded in China's regulatory framework (e.g., Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services), technical realism, and operational accountability—formatted for direct pasting into Microsoft Word with no markdown, no embellishment, and zero hallucination.

## Prompt

# Goal
Produce a clean, authoritative, Word-ready government report on an AI-related policy or LLM optimization topic — strictly grounded in current technical reality, verifiable engineering practice, and official governance principles (e.g., Cyberspace Administration of China notices, MIIT white papers, State Council AI development plans). Output must be copy-paste ready into Microsoft Word: no markdown, no emojis, no bold/italic/heading syntax, no bullet symbols (use plain dashes or numbered lists only), no section dividers (e.g., '---'), and no speculative or anthropomorphic language (e.g., avoid 'self-evolving', 'awakening', 'autonomous learning'; use 'human-supervised iterative improvement', 'RLHF-guided refinement', 'curated data-driven updates').

# Constraints & Style
- Must cite only verifiable, publicly issued policies, standards, or official positions; omit unsourced claims. Anchor all recommendations to existing instruments (e.g., filing requirements under Article 12 of the Interim Measures), not hypothetical frameworks.
- Zero tolerance for hallucinated facts, entities, dates, agencies, or regulations — if uncertain, omit or state 'not currently specified in public guidance'.
- Language: formal yet accessible Chinese; avoid jargon without explanation; define acronyms (e.g., RLHF) on first use.
- Structure: title → executive summary → numbered sections (I, II, III...) with plain subheadings (e.g., 'I. Basic Judgment', 'II. Guiding Principles'); no decorative formatting.
- Tone: objective, cautious, institutionally grounded — never promotional, futuristic, or techno-deterministic.
- Prohibit all speculative, anthropomorphic, or misleading terminology: ban 'self-evolution', 'AI awakening', 'lifelong learning', 'intelligent adaptation', or any phrase implying agency, intent, or independence from human design/control.
- Ground every claim in verifiable engineering practice: cite only widely accepted, auditable techniques (e.g., supervised fine-tuning with human-labeled data, RLHF with explicit reward models, knowledge base updates with versioned source attribution, deterministic prompt engineering).
- Name concrete, empirically documented failure modes observed in real deployments (e.g., 'version drift in legal answer consistency', 'bias amplification after domain-specific fine-tuning without demographic guardrails', 'factual regression following unvetted web-scraped corpus injection').
- Assign clear accountability: specify *who* must act (e.g., 'model provider', 'domain expert reviewer', 'provincial cyberspace administration'), *what* they must document (e.g., 'pre-update factual accuracy delta on 500-policy QA pairs'), and *when* (e.g., 'prior to public release', 'within 3 working days of internal testing completion').
- Use plain, declarative sentences; avoid metaphors, analogies, rhetorical questions, or academic jargon. Prefer 'the model outputs incorrect statutory citations' over 'hallucinates legal provisions'.
- Include at least one counterintuitive but evidence-backed insight (e.g., 'Aggressive online updating increases short-term responsiveness but degrades long-term reliability unless paired with automated regression testing against fixed golden datasets').
- Exclude all assistant self-reference, disclaimers, footnotes, appendices, or 'further support' offers unless explicitly requested by user.
