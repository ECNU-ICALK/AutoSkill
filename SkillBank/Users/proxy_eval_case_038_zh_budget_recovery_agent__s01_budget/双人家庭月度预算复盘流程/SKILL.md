# 双人家庭月度预算复盘流程

A standardized, time-boxed monthly review ritual for two-adult households to jointly assess spending alignment with weekly budget rules, identify systemic patterns, and co-create one actionable adjustment—designed to sustain motivation without administrative burden.

## Prompt

# Goal
Facilitate a consistent, 45-minute monthly budget review for a two-person household that surfaces insights from weekly spending data (especially autonomous & emergency exceptions), confirms adherence to the weekly cap + exception rules, and results in exactly one concrete, shared action for the next month.

# Constraints & Style
- Duration strictly capped at 45 minutes; use a visible timer.
- Only two people participate — no children, extended family, or third parties.
- Must reference actual data: prior month’s weekly autonomous budget amounts, actual spends, emergency exception logs (with dates, reasons, amounts, signatures), and any triggered red/yellow alerts.
- Output is *only* three items: (1) one sentence on overall pattern (“We stayed within weekly caps 3/4 weeks; exceptions were all valid”), (2) one root-cause insight (“60% of autonomous overspend occurred weekday evenings after 8pm”), and (3) one jointly signed micro-action (“Both will charge phones outside bedroom starting next Monday”).
- No discussion of income changes, long-term goals, or debt payoff plans — those belong in a separate quarterly session.
- Tone must be neutral, non-judgmental, and forward-looking; avoid words like 'failed', 'slipped', or 'guilty'. Use only observable behavior (“ordered takeout 4x Tue–Thu”) not assumptions (“we’re lazy”).

# Workflow
1. **Prep (done before meeting)**: One person compiles last month’s data into a single 1-page summary: weekly autonomous budgets vs. actuals, list of emergency exceptions (with signed PDF names), and count of yellow/red alerts triggered.
2. **Minute 0–5**: Set timer. Each person shares *one thing they felt proud of financially this month* (e.g., “I canceled 3 auto-renews”, “I used the negotiation script with the gym”).
3. **Minute 5–25**: Review the 1-page summary together. Ask only: “What repeated pattern stands out?” → record verbatim on paper. No analysis yet.
4. **Minute 25–35**: Select *one* pattern. Ask: “What’s one tiny, physical, shared action we can both do next month to shift it?” → draft it as a specific, observable behavior.
5. **Minute 35–45**: Write the final output (pattern sentence, insight, micro-action) on a sticky note. Both sign it. Stick it on the fridge. Reset timer for next month’s meeting.
