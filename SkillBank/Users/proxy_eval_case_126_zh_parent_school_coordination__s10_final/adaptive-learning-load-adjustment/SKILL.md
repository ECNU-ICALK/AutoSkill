# adaptive-learning-load-adjustment

A reusable, three-tiered protocol for dynamically reducing cognitive load during family learning sessions based on observable behavioral signals—preserving continuity of math, language, and English practice, routine integrity, documentation, and caregiver-teacher alignment without introducing new tools or expectations.

## Prompt

# Goal
Maintain consistent developmental engagement across days/weeks by implementing pre-defined, time-bounded, reversible adjustments to the daily home learning structure when the student exhibits concrete, non-inferential signs of fatigue or disengagement—without omitting any core subject domain, breaking routine, requiring re-prep, or compromising emotional safety or shared accountability.

# Constraints & Style
- Must preserve *all three subject domains daily*: math (conceptual grounding), language (text interaction), English (oral output). No domain may be omitted.
- Adjustments must be *pre-specified, observable-triggered, and reversible*: e.g., '30+20+10' replaces '40+30+20'; triggered only by user-observed, non-inferential signals (e.g., 'refuses to hold pencil', 'lies down', 'uses <3 words/hour', 'covers eyes for >30 sec')—never by subjective labels like 'tired' or 'distracted'.
- All reductions must retain the *minimum completion unit* for each subject (e.g., math: 1 real-world operation + 1 sentence explanation; English: 1 recorded phrase + 1 self-identified word).
- Never frame reduction as 'failure' or 'fallback'; instead name it descriptively and positively (e.g., 'Energy-Sync Mode', 'Focus Anchor Version').
- Avoid introducing new tools, roles, assessments, metrics, or expectations—only repurpose existing plan assets (e.g., 'pause coin', 'B-level text', 'slow-speed audio', 'classroom gold quote wall').
- Every tier requires the 'check-in' action: child expresses state non-verbally (color, sticker, pause), caregiver names one observed detail without judgment, teacher acknowledges with a pre-aligned, asset-focused response.
- All outputs and logs must remain de-identified: no names, dates, schools, or personal identifiers in templates or records.
- Do not require teacher re-prep or parent upskilling to activate; initiation must take ≤5 minutes and use zero new materials.

# Workflow
1. Recognize signal: Caregiver observes ≥1 non-inferential behavioral signal from the defined threshold list.
2. Apply pre-agreed elastic tier:
   - Tier 1 (mild dip): 30min focus + 20min practice + 10min review (60% total time)
   - Tier 2 (significant dip): 20min focus + 15min practice + 5min review (44% total time), with all tasks limited to *one* minimum unit per subject
   - Tier 3 (acute withdrawal): 10min focus + 10min practice + 5min review (28% total time), retaining only the check-in + one minimum unit per subject, all using pre-existing assets
3. Maintain structure integrity: Keep same sequence (focus → practice → review), same roles (caregiver as observer/facilitator, child as narrator/actor), same output format (e.g., still record English, still draw one math sketch, still circle one reading keyword).
4. Log adjustment: Note in weekly sync template using standardized phrase: '[启用X级缓冲] + one concrete observation'.
5. Teacher responds within 24h using the corresponding pre-written reply block—unchanged except for bracketed placeholders (e.g., [child's color], [small task]).
6. Auto-reset: Return to full structure next session unless signal repeats ≥2 days; if Tier 2 repeats ≥2 days or any Tier 3 occurs, automatically trigger teacher review of next-week plan for proactive simplification (e.g., downgrade all texts, pre-load slow audio, remove oral output requirement).
