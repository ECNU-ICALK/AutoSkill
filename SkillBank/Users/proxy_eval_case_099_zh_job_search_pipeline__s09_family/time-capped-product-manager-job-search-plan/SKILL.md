# time-capped-product-manager-job-search-plan

A structured 10-week job search plan for product manager candidates, strictly bounded to ≤12 hours per week, prioritizing high-leverage activities and preventing burnout.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a realistic, sustainable 10-week job search plan for a product manager candidate (entry-level or career-switcher), delivering actionable weekly sprints that collectively cover resume optimization, targeted applications, internal referrals, and interview simulation — all while enforcing a hard cap of **no more than 12 hours per week**.

# Constraints & Style
- ⚠️ MUST enforce strict time budget: each week’s plan must be executable in ≤12 hours total (e.g., 1.5–2 hrs/day Mon–Fri, or 3 hrs/day Mon–Thu). No exceptions.
- ⚠️ MUST exclude low-ROI activities: no generic networking events, no untargeted content creation (e.g., blog posts), no tool deep-dives beyond what’s needed for immediate application (e.g., Figma basics only — not advanced prototyping).
- ✅ MUST prioritize output-driven actions with clear验收 criteria (e.g., “1 revised resume section with 3 quantified bullets”, not “study resume writing”).
- ✅ MUST integrate the four user-specified pillars: resume optimization, job applications, internal referrals, and full-cycle mock interviews — distributed across weeks without overlap or redundancy.
- ✅ MUST include explicit weekly time allocation (e.g., 'Mon: 2h resume edit; Tue: 1.5h JD analysis; Wed: 1h portfolio snippet') — not just goals.
- ✅ Language: concise, imperative, de-identified — no company names, tools beyond essentials (e.g., 'Figma' or 'Notion', not 'Figma v127.3'), no personal identifiers.

# Workflow
1. Week 1: Diagnose — spend ≤2h collecting 5–8 real PM job descriptions; ≤1h mapping gaps; ≤1h drafting personal priority list (TOP 3 skill gaps).
2. Week 2: Optimize resume — allocate ≤3h total: ≤1h rewriting summary, ≤1.5h revising 2 work experiences using STAR-L + metrics, ≤0.5h ATS formatting check.
3. Week 3: Build lightweight portfolio — ≤2.5h: ≤1h selecting/structuring 1 project, ≤1h assembling visuals + narrative, ≤0.5h scripting 3-min walkthrough.
4. Week 4: Skill patch — ≤2h: ≤1h data exercise (e.g., funnel calc on sample dataset), ≤0.5h PRD outline, ≤0.5h business reading + note capture.
5. Week 5: Interview prep — ≤2h: ≤1h categorizing 10 core questions + drafting answer skeletons, ≤1h recording & reviewing 1 self-intro + 1 behavioral answer.
6. Week 6: Mock interview — ≤2.5h: ≤1.5h live 45-min session + note-taking, ≤1h synthesizing top 3 feedback points.
7. Week 7: Customize — ≤2h: ≤1h researching 1 target company’s recent launch, ≤0.5h adapting resume bullet, ≤0.5h drafting ‘Why Us’ statement.
8. Week 8: Apply & refer — ≤3h: ≤1.5h submitting 4 tailored applications (incl. 1 personalized cover note each), ≤1h sending 2 warm intro requests (with pre-written message), ≤0.5h updating tracker.
9. Week 9: Refine — ≤2h: ≤1h drilling weakest question type (e.g., 3 analysis drills), ≤0.5h refining 1 ‘anti-burnout’ follow-up email, ≤0.5h writing psychological reset note.
10. Week 10: Consolidate — ≤1.5h: finalizing master resume PDF, archiving all artifacts, documenting 3 reusable templates (cover note, intro message, tracker).
