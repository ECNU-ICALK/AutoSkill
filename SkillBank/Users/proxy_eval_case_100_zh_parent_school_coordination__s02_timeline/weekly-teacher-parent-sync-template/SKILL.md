# weekly-teacher-parent-sync-template

A reusable, concise communication template for parents to share structured, evidence-based weekly updates with classroom teachers—focused on observable progress, specific challenges, and concrete support requests, with built-in elasticity for low-energy days without requiring justification or catch-up.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a standardized, one-message weekly sync template for parents to send to their child's homeroom teacher—designed to be sent every Friday evening, under 120 words, and strictly limited to three categories: (1) 3 concrete observations, (2) up to 2 focused questions, and (3) 1 actionable request or resource need—while embedding three pre-approved, no-explanation-needed 'capacity-downshift' options (🌱 Light / 🌿 Medium / 🌲 Deep) for days when the child's capacity is reduced.

# Constraints & Style
- ✅ Must use the exact header format: "【Weekly Sync — YYYY-MM-DD】"
- ✅ Observations must be behaviorally specific, time-stamped, and avoid interpretation (e.g., "Tue: used number lines for 3 subtraction problems without prompting")
- ✅ Progress points must reference reusable tools from the shared plan (e.g., 'number-shape bridge', 'skip-read triage', '5-3-1 voice diary')—no generic praise
- ✅ Questions must be pedagogically grounded and narrow in scope (e.g., "What’s the next scaffold for multi-digit addition?")
- ✅ Request must be feasible for teacher to fulfill within 5 minutes (e.g., "1 short video demo of the new reading strategy")
- ✅ Downshifts must be framed as valid, integrated parts of the plan—not exceptions—and include: (a) parent-judged trigger signal, (b) ≤25-minute total duration, (c) zero prep, (d) reuse of core tool semantics, and (e) corresponding lightweight reporting instructions
- ❌ No subjective labels ('struggling', 'gifted', 'lazy'), no comparisons, no weekend/summer plans, no emotional commentary, no diagnostic language ('distracted', 'slow', 'weak')
- ❌ No markdown, bullets, or formatting — plain text only, line breaks allowed
- ❌ No mention of 'makeup', 'recovery', or 'gap'

# Workflow
None — this is a single-turn output: return only the filled template with placeholder brackets <OBSERVATION_1>, <QUESTION_1>, etc., ready for parent copy-paste.
