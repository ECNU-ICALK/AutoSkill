# dual-adult-budget-rhythm-system

A paired, time-boxed financial practice for dual-adult households combining a daily 5-minute behavioral checkpoint with a monthly 45-minute rule-calibration review—designed to sustain budget discipline through observable actions, shared agency, and iterative process refinement.

## Prompt

# Goal
Support a two-person household in maintaining consistent financial alignment via two complementary rituals: (1) a daily 5-minute checklist completed together each evening to surface today’s behavior and reinforce shared agency, and (2) a monthly 45-minute review to diagnose recurring drift, validate rule effectiveness, and co-sign one micro-adjustment for the next cycle.

# Constraints & Style
- Daily checklist must be executable in ≤5 minutes using only pen/paper or a shared note; monthly review must complete in ≤45 minutes with no spreadsheets or calculations.
- Daily output: exactly 5 action-oriented, observable, time-bound items (each ≤90 seconds), requiring dual participation (e.g., "one names / the other writes"); include exactly one behavioral anchor tied to a specific time window (e.g., "before 21:00") and one non-judgmental micro-recognition (e.g., "name one thing that felt easier today").
- Monthly output: exactly three artifacts — (1) a 3-bullet 'What Actually Happened' summary (fact-based, no judgment), (2) a single 'Rule Stress Test' finding (e.g., 'The <EXCEPTION_RULE_NAME> was bypassed X times — mostly for <COMMON_SPENDING_CATEGORY>'), and (3) one jointly committed 'Next-Cycle Micro-Adjustment' (e.g., 'Move <ROUTINE_TASK> to Sunday evening; freeze <BEHAVIOR_CATEGORY> Mon–Thu').
- Language must be neutral, non-shaming, and grounded in observed behavior — never attribute motive or use vague goals.
- Exclude income analysis, debt math, forecasts, balances, totals, or vendor/platform names; use de-identified placeholders like <EXCEPTION_RULE_NAME>, <COMMON_SPENDING_CATEGORY>, <WEEKLY_CAP>, <ROUTINE_TASK>, <BEHAVIOR_CATEGORY>.
- No automation, apps, notifications, or real-time tracking — assume low-tech, shared-note or paper-only execution.

# Workflow
1. **Daily (5 min, every evening):** Complete the 5-item checklist together — anchored to a consistent time window (e.g., after dinner), ending with mutual acknowledgment of one micro-recognition.
2. **Monthly (45 min, same day each month):** Each person preps independently (5 min): (a) one financially proud moment, (b) one noticed but unchanged spending pattern → then sync (30 min) to draft the three required artifacts → close (10 min) by signing/dating the 'Next-Cycle Micro-Adjustment'.
