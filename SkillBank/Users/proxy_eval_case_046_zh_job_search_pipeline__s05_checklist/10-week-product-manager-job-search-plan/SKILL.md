# 10-week-product-manager-job-search-plan

A time-boxed, outcome-driven 10-week plan for product manager job seekers, enforcing strict daily (≤2.5h) and weekly (≤12h) time caps and aligning all activities (resume optimization, targeted applications, referral outreach, interview simulation) to concrete hiring outcomes — with built-in daily execution discipline and weekly review/planning protocols to sustain momentum and adapt based on measured results.

## Prompt

# Goal
Execute a sustainable, high-leverage 10-week product manager job search plan that delivers at least 3 qualified interview invitations — while capping daily effort at ≤2.5 hours and total weekly effort at ≤12 hours — and maintain momentum via disciplined daily execution and a metrics-driven weekly review and action planning cycle.

# Constraints & Style
- ✅ Enforce hard time budgets: no day may exceed 2.5 hours; no week may exceed 12 hours. All tasks must be atomic, time-stamped, and sum to ≤2.5h/day and ≤12h/week; no single task may exceed 2.5h.
- ✅ All deliverables must close the loop to hiring outcomes: resume edits must reference real JDs; cover letters must cite specific product features; interview prep must reuse actual questions from target companies.
- ✅ Prioritize leverage: e.g., one well-researched referral message > ten spray-and-pray applications; one quantified resume bullet > three vague responsibilities.
- ✅ Daily checklist must contain exactly 3 concrete, outcome-oriented tasks — each specifying deliverable, max time, and explicit stop condition (e.g., 'Stop at 45 min even if incomplete', 'If draft exceeds 3 sentences, truncate and move on').
- ✅ Weekly review must include: (1) time spent vs. budget (e.g., '4.2h / 12h'), (2) outcome metrics tracked (e.g., '3 cover letters sent → 1 reply'), (3) one sentence on what worked and one on what stalled — no narrative, no justification.
- ✅ Next-week action plan must list 3–5 atomic, time-stamped tasks (e.g., 'Mon 10:00–10:30: Revise Summary section using JD keywords → 0.5h'), each with explicit duration and output format (e.g., 'PDF', 'Mermaid diagram', '3-sentence message').
- ❌ Do not include open-ended upskilling (e.g., 'study agile', 'learn Figma basics') unless triggered by a gap identified in a real JD or interview feedback.
- ❌ Do not assume full-time availability — all scheduling, task breakdowns, and pacing must reflect part-time, disciplined execution.
- ❌ Reject generic advice: no 'learn PM fundamentals' or 'build side projects' without direct linkage to a live application or interview requirement.
- ❌ Output only two labeled sections: 'This Week Review' and 'Next Week Action Plan'; no tables, emojis, branding, motivational language, or explanations.
- ❌ De-identify all company names, tools, platforms, and personal details (e.g., '<TARGET_COMPANY>', '<JD_SOURCE>', '<OUTREACH_PLATFORM>').
- ❌ Daily checklist outputs must be executable in one sitting, produce tangible, interview- or application-ready artifacts, and avoid multi-day dependencies or open-ended work.
