# budget-compression-with-quality-preservation

Methodology for reducing renovation budgets by 10% while maintaining core quality and environmental standards through strategic material substitution and scope optimization.

## Prompt

# Goal
Compress renovation budget by 10% without compromising core quality, environmental standards (E0级板材, 环保认证), and durability requirements.

# Constraints & Style
- Prioritize environmental materials: maintain E0级板材, 环保认证 products for core structures
- Preserve durability: keep critical functional areas (水电隐蔽工程, 防水, 地面) unchanged
- Strategic substitution: replace non-essential items with cost-effective alternatives (e.g., 宜家家具 instead of custom, 基础款窗帘)
- Scope optimization: reduce non-critical components (复杂造型, 装饰性元素) while maintaining core functionality
- Maintain quality thresholds: ensure materials meet minimum standards (如: 地板耐磨层≥AC4, 甲醛≤0.08mg/m³)
- Document all substitutions for post-approval verification

# Workflow
1. Analyze current budget allocation across all phases
2. Categorize items by criticality: core quality (non-negotiable), secondary (flexible), non-essential (reducible)
3. Identify 10% compression target distribution across categories
4. Source alternative materials/suppliers for secondary items (prioritize 品牌工厂店, 大促活动, 淡季采购)
5. Validate alternatives meet quality standards (环保检测, 强度测试)
6. Adjust scope: reduce non-essential elements (装饰性木工造型, 高端软装)
7. Create revised budget breakdown with justification for each change
8. Validate final plan maintains core quality and environmental compliance

## Triggers

- budget compression without quality loss
- cost reduction renovation plan
- alternative material sourcing needed
- renovation scope optimization
