# formal-report-drafting-with-executable-structure

Generates formal, policy-ready report drafts that are structurally rigorous, linguistically restrained, and operationally actionable — avoiding decorative formatting in favor of plain, hierarchical prose with clear section logic, explicit responsibility assignment, and quantifiable success metrics.

## Prompt

# Goal
Produce a formal, executable draft report on a public-service or community policy topic. Output must be self-contained, ready for internal review or inter-agency circulation, with no reliance on visual formatting.

# Constraints & Style
- Use only plain Markdown: headings (##, ###), numbered/lettered lists (e.g., '### Three. Optimization Measures' → '(a) Measure name'), and line breaks — no tables, icons (▶, ●), bold/italic emphasis, decorative separators (---, ***), or bullet clusters.
- Maintain formal register: third-person, passive-voice preferred where appropriate, no contractions, no colloquialisms, metaphors, rhetorical flourishes, emotive phrasing, or value-laden adjectives (e.g., 'innovative', 'cutting-edge').
- Prioritize executability: every recommendation must specify *what*, *by whom*, and *on what timeline or condition* — use concrete action verbs (e.g., 'establish', 'deploy', 'certify', 'integrate', 'audit'); avoid vague aspirations (e.g., 'enhance', 'promote', 'explore').
- Assign accountability explicitly: name accountable entities (e.g., <LOCAL_GOVERNMENT_UNIT>, <DISTRICT_AGENCY>, <THIRD_PARTY_CONTRACTOR>) — never use vague terms like 'stakeholders' or 'relevant departments'.
- Require quantification: each measure must include at least one time-bound, observable, and independently verifiable metric (e.g., 'achieve ≥90% compliance by <IMPLEMENTATION_PERIOD>', 'reduce processing latency to ≤15 calendar days', 'attain ≥85% satisfaction in biannual third-party survey').
- Ground feasibility: anchor all proposals in existing policy authority, budgetary mechanisms, or operational capacity — exclude speculative legislation, unallocated funding, or undefined partnerships.
- Omit all placeholder tokens (e.g., <TOKEN>), project-specific names, exact statistics unless essential to the logic, and citations/attachments unless explicitly requested; reference supporting materials only as named, versioned, and scoped attachments (e.g., 'Attachment 1: Survey Instrument v2.1').
- De-identify all entities: replace specific locations, agencies, dates, numbers, programs, and organizations with generic placeholders (e.g., <LOCAL_GOVERNMENT_UNIT>, <TARGET_POPULATION>, <IMPLEMENTATION_PERIOD>, <VERSION>).

# Workflow
1. Begin with title and metadata line (e.g., 'Report Draft: <TOPIC>', 'Prepared for: <STAKEHOLDER_GROUP>', 'Date: <YEAR>').
2. Structure sequentially: (I) Background & Necessity → (II) Diagnosed Problems (evidence-sourced, non-anecdotal) → (III) Actionable Recommendations (grouped by domain, responsibility- and metric-annotated) → (IV) Enabling Conditions / Implementation Safeguards (governance, resourcing, accountability) → (V) Conclusion with next-step directive (framed as readiness-for-decision).
3. For each recommendation in Section III, state: (a) the intervention (action verb + object), (b) the responsible entity, (c) the implementation trigger or timeframe, and (d) at least one quantified outcome indicator with verification method — all in one coherent sentence or two tightly linked sentences.
