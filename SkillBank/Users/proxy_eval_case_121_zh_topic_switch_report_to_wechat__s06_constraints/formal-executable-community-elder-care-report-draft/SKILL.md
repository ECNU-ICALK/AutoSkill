# formal-executable-community-elder-care-report-draft

Generates a formal, restrained, and operationally actionable draft report on community elder care optimization — suitable for government or public service stakeholders — using only prose, with explicit responsibility assignment, time-bound actions, and quantifiable, verifiable success criteria.

## Prompt

# Goal
Produce a formal, restrained, and executable draft report on community elder care optimization — suitable for submission to government or public service stakeholders — using only prose (no tables), with emphasis on actionable mechanisms, clear accountability, policy-aligned implementation logic, and quantifiable outcomes.

# Constraints & Style
- Tone: Formal, neutral, and authoritative; avoid advocacy language, superlatives, speculation, hypotheticals, or unverifiable claims.
- Structure: Use standard report sections (e.g., Background, Goals, Core Measures, Implementation Safeguards, Next Steps); label sections plainly (e.g., '### Background').
- Prose-only: Replace all tabular data with concise, parallel bullet points or embedded metric statements (e.g., 'Target: 100% electronic “one-household-one-plan” coverage by 2025-08-31').
- Executability focus: Every proposed measure must name responsible actors (e.g., 'community health stations', 'district civil affairs bureau', 'street office'), specify delivery mechanisms (e.g., 'via shared API gateway', 'through quarterly inter-agency coordination meetings'), and reference verifiable outputs (e.g., 'signed SOP for service referral', 'deployed fall-risk alert protocol').
- Deadlines: Use specific, realistic dates (YYYY-MM-DD) or quarter/year format only if user explicitly permits fiscal quarters; avoid vague terms like 'soon' or 'in the near term'.
- Outcomes: Quantify and verify every success criterion (e.g., 'reduce duplicate registration to ≤5%', 'maintain device uptime ≥99.5%', 'achieve 100% electronic建档 rate').
- De-identify: Omit all proper nouns (e.g., street names, agency names, unreproducible local statistics), project IDs, URLs, dates beyond year/quarter unless concrete and user-provided; retain only structural metrics (e.g., '40% social capital participation target') and universally applicable mechanisms (e.g., 'embedded time-banking with low-age seniors').
- No appendices or attachments: Integrate key supporting logic into main text (e.g., 'Cost recovery is enabled via tiered pricing: base-level assistance remains publicly funded; premium add-ons are market-priced and opt-in').
- Never invent policy authority, legal thresholds, or funding mechanisms not grounded in user-provided context.
- Omit placeholder tokens (e.g., <NUM>, <TOKEN>); replace with concrete values if user provides them; otherwise omit or use generic phrasing like 'within six months of approval'.

# Workflow
1. Extract core optimization dimensions from user context (e.g., demand responsiveness, resource integration, sustainability).
2. For each dimension, articulate one concrete, actor-specific, mechanism-driven measure — phrased as an active commitment, not a proposal — including named accountable entity, specific deadline, and quantifiable outcome.
3. Consolidate cross-cutting enablers (governance, funding, oversight) into a dedicated safeguards section using plain-English operational terms, naming accountability bodies and review frequency.
4. Conclude with three specific, time-bound, stakeholder-assignable next steps — no open-ended recommendations.
