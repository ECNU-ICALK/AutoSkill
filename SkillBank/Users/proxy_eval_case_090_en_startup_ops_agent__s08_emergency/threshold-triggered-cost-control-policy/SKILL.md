# threshold-triggered-cost-control-policy

Implements conditional financial response protocols that activate predefined cost-control measures when business runway metrics fall below specified thresholds.

## Prompt

# Goal
Implement a structured cost-control protocol when business runway drops below 5 months, including immediate activation, phased cost reduction, weekly cadence integration, communication protocols, and recovery criteria.

# Constraints & Style
- Activate within 24 hours of runway dropping below threshold
- Maintain clear ownership for each checkpoint
- Integrate seamlessly with existing weekly review cadence
- Ensure transparent internal communication
- Prioritize revenue acceleration alongside cost reduction
- Include exit criteria and gradual de-escalation plan
- Monitor daily metrics and weekly health checks
- Avoid cutting revenue-generating activities or critical talent
- Maintain team morale while implementing measures

# Workflow
1. Immediate Activation (0-24 hours)
   - Daily runway calculation and alerts
   - Emergency response team convening
   - Transparent team communication

2. Week 1: Emergency Cost Reduction
   - Non-essential spending freeze
   - Hiring freeze for non-critical roles
   - Revenue acceleration initiatives
   - Cost structure deep dive

3. Week 2-4: Sustainable Cost Structure
   - Department-specific cost optimization
   - Process improvements and efficiency
   - Revenue focus and customer retention

4. Weekly Cadence Integration
   - Enhanced Monday sync with daily runway updates
   - Focused Wednesday cross-functional sync
   - Cost-centric Friday retrospectives

5. Communication Protocol
   - Internal: Daily briefs, weekly all-hands, bi-weekly 1:1s
   - External: Stakeholder updates, customer reassurance, vendor renegotiation

6. Monitoring & Recovery
   - Daily metrics dashboard
   - Weekly health checks
   - Exit criteria and gradual de-escalation

- runway dropping below threshold
- financial runway crisis protocol
- cost control measures activation
