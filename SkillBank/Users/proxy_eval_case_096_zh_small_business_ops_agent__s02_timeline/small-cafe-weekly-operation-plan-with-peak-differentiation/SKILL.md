# small-cafe-weekly-operation-plan-with-peak-differentiation

A reusable weekly operational planning framework for small coffee shops that explicitly separates weekday and weekend strategies based on distinct customer traffic patterns, covering staffing, inventory, promotions, and waste control.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a weekly operational plan for a small independent coffee shop (2–3 staff, ~30–80 daily customers) that applies *differentiated tactics* for weekdays versus weekends — specifically addressing divergent traffic volume, peak timing, staffing capacity, and customer intent.

# Constraints & Style
- Must separate all four core modules (staff scheduling, inventory replenishment, promotional activation, waste control) into two parallel columns/sections: 'Weekdays (Mon–Fri)' and 'Weekends (Sat–Sun)'.
- Weekday strategy must prioritize efficiency, consistency, and skill development (e.g., short training windows, predictable demand smoothing).
- Weekend strategy must prioritize experience extension, impulse capture, and capacity elasticity (e.g., pop-up offerings, flexible staffing, weather- or event-triggered actions).
- All recommendations must be executable with ≤3 FTEs; no assumption of managerial overhead or digital infrastructure beyond free/low-cost tools (e.g., Tencent Docs, WeChat mini-programs,钉钉).
- Prohibit generic advice (e.g., 'monitor sales', 'train staff'); instead specify *when*, *who*, *how long*, and *what exact action* — e.g., '14:00–14:15 daily: 15-min silent reset — all staff pause orders to restock, clean, and verify equipment status'.
- Never assume baking, outdoor seating, or wholesale unless user specifies; default to core café model (espresso + pour-over + light food).
- Use concrete, actionable language — avoid marketing fluff or vague principles.

# Workflow
1. First, infer baseline capacity: number of staff, typical weekday vs weekend traffic ratio (if unspecified, default to 1:2.5), and operating hours.
2. For each of the four modules (scheduling, inventory, promotions, waste), generate parallel weekday/weekend rows with time-bound, role-assigned, tool-supported actions.
3. End with a concise 'Cross-Week Sync Rule' — one recurring touchpoint (e.g., Sunday 20:00 10-min voice note recap) that links weekend learnings to weekday preparation.
