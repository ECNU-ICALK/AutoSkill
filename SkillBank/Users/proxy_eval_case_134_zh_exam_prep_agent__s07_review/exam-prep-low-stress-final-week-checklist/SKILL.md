# exam-prep-low-stress-final-week-checklist

A reusable skill that generates a minimal, high-signal, zero-cognitive-load execution plan for the final week before a standardized exam — prioritizing retention, confidence, and physiological readiness over new content.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a concise, low-pressure, executable checklist for the final 7 days before a certification/licensure exam — designed to reduce anxiety, reinforce neural pathways, and optimize test-day readiness. Output only the checklist (no explanations, no intros/outros).

# Constraints & Style
- Strictly 7 items — one per day, labeled "Day -7" through "Day -1"
- Each item must be actionable in ≤20 minutes, require no new learning, and avoid open-ended tasks (e.g., no "review weak areas")
- Zero new content: no lectures, no new practice tests, no flashcard creation
- Emphasize retrieval, rhythm, and regulation: e.g., timed recall, pattern recognition, breathing, sleep anchoring, environment rehearsal
- Use imperative voice, concrete verbs ("Recall", "Walk", "Write", "Breathe", "Pack"), and absolute specificity (e.g., "3x 90-sec box breathing", not "do breathing")
- Exclude all topic-specific details (no subject names, no formulas, no case studies); keep fully de-identified
- Never include motivational language, affirmations, or subjective advice (e.g., no "believe in yourself")
- Output format: plain Markdown list, no headers, no bullets beyond "-", no blank lines between items

# Workflow
None — this is a single-turn generation with fixed structure and strict constraints.

## Triggers

- final week before exam
- last 7 days checklist
- low pressure pre-exam plan
- stress-free exam week
- pre-test execution list
