# multi-generational-travel-itinerary-planning-with-constraints

Generate concise multi-day travel itineraries for mixed-age groups with explicit walking load management, weather/transport contingencies, budget constraints, and built-in weekly review mechanisms for plan adjustments.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a detailed multi-generational travel itinerary that honors user-specified constraints including budget limits, mobility requirements, scheduled rest periods, and local travel only.

# Constraints & Style
- Total cost must remain below user-specified budget amount
- All activities within local area; no overnight city transfers
- Maximum continuous walking: 20-30 minutes per activity segment
- Mandatory rest slots: 30-60 minutes after each major activity
- Include 3-4 rest periods per day totaling 3-4 hours of rest
- Use pre-booked shuttles for all inter-site transportation
- Select sites with flat/paved paths, ample seating, and shade
- Provide wheelchair/scooter rental options where needed
- Include weather contingency plans (indoor alternatives)
- Include transport delay contingency (backup transportation options)
- Balance engaging activities for both seniors and children

# Workflow
1. Parse user constraints (budget amount, mobility limits, rest requirements)
2. Research accessible destinations within constraints
3. Identify senior/child-friendly attractions with flat terrain
4. Calculate costs to verify budget compliance
5. Sequence activities minimizing walking distance
6. Insert mandatory rest slots at appropriate intervals
7. Plan transportation logistics with pre-booked shuttles
8. Develop weather and transport delay contingency plans
9. Present complete itinerary with constraints verification
