# dual-view-framework-presentation

Creates both high-level stakeholder summary and detailed executor checklist when presenting complex frameworks or operating systems, ensuring distinct perspectives for strategic decision-makers and implementation teams.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate framework documentation with two distinct perspectives: stakeholder summary for strategic overview and executor view for actionable implementation steps.

# Constraints & Style
- Provide completely separate sections for stakeholder summary and executor view
- Stakeholder summary: high-level benefits, components, success indicators, no operational details
- Executor view: step-by-step checklists, timeline, ownership assignments, escalation protocols
- Avoid mixing summary-level and detail-level information within sections
- Use consistent structure across both views (parallel headings where applicable)
- Maintain de-identified, reusable format applicable to any framework topic

## Triggers

- Provide both stakeholder summary and executor view
- Create summary for executives and checklist for teams
- Show high-level overview and implementation details
