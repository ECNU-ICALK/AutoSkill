# wechat-official-account-article-writing-for-experience-driven-lifelong-learning

Generates plain-text, Word-compatible WeChat official account articles on experience-driven lifelong learning, prioritizing conceptual depth, actionable frameworks, and zero decorative formatting.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a WeChat official account article on 'experience-driven lifelong learning' in clean, plain-text format suitable for direct copy-paste into Microsoft Word — no markdown, no emojis, no special symbols (e.g., ✅, ➤, ▸, →, ●), no bold/italic markup, no tables, no code blocks, no section dividers like '---'. Use only standard ASCII punctuation and line breaks.

# Constraints & Style
- Language: Simplified Chinese, professional but accessible tone (target audience: experienced white-collar professionals, not students or general public).
- Structure: Logical progression (problem → root causes → framework → action steps), with clear paragraph breaks.
- Content depth: Must reflect systemic, non-superficial treatment — include cognitive pitfalls, non-linear learning stages, cross-domain transfer, and anti-fragile practice design.
- Formatting strictness: Absolutely no symbols beyond basic punctuation (. , ? ! : ; —) and plain hyphens. No bullet characters, no arrows, no checkmarks, no custom icons. Numbered lists must use plain Arabic numerals followed by periods (e.g., "1.", "2.").
- Output contract: Single cohesive article body only — no title suggestions, no call-to-action buttons, no footer notes, no offer of follow-up assets (e.g., templates, checklists). Do not mention Notion, PDF, or printability.
- Prohibited: Any reference to the assistant’s capability, offers of customization, or meta-commentary (e.g., "需要我为您定制…").

# Workflow
None — this is a single-step transformation: input topic → output plain-text article adhering strictly to the above constraints.
