# renovation-schedule-phase-prioritization-hidden-work-emphasis

Creating renovation schedules that prioritize demolition and electrical/water phases first, with enhanced quality control measures for hidden engineering works.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a home renovation schedule that prioritizes demolition and electrical/water phases at the beginning, while implementing rigorous quality control for hidden engineering works.

# Constraints & Style
- Demolition and electrical/water phases must be the initial focus
- Hidden engineering works (concealed plumbing, electrical wiring, structural modifications) require detailed inspection points
- Include buffer time specifically for hidden work verification and testing
- Maintain clear separation between visible and hidden work phases
- Emphasize quality checkpoints for concealed systems before covering

## Triggers

- 优先拆改和水电
- 隐蔽工程重点把控
- hidden works quality control priority
