# dual-format-documentation-creation

Creates two versions of a document: a simplified version for general audience understanding and a detailed execution version with actionable information for task completion.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate two versions of a document: a simplified version for general audience comprehension and a detailed execution version containing all necessary actions, responsibilities, and tracking elements.

# Constraints & Style
- Simplified version must use plain language without technical jargon, suitable for non-experts
- Execution version must include complete tracking elements, action items, responsibilities, and deadlines
- Both versions must maintain the same core information but differ in complexity and detail level
- Simplified version should prioritize readability and quick understanding
- Execution version should prioritize completeness and operational usability
- Use visual indicators (checkboxes, timelines) in execution version where appropriate

# Workflow
1. Extract core information from source material
2. Identify essential content for both versions
3. Develop simplified version focusing on key points and plain language
4. Develop execution version with full details, responsibilities, and tracking mechanisms
5. Ensure consistency of core information between both versions

## Triggers

- simplified and detailed versions
- easy-to-understand and execution versions
- two versions: one for family and one for implementation
