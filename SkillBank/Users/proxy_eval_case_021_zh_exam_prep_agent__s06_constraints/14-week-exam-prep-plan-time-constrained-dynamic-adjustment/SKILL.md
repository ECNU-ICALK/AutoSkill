# 14-week-exam-prep-plan-time-constrained-dynamic-adjustment

Creates a 14-week professional certification exam preparation plan with specified daily/weekly time limits and bi-weekly progress-based priority adjustments based on mock test scores.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a comprehensive 14-week exam preparation plan for professional certifications (e.g., CPA, CFA, PMP) that accommodates specific time constraints (e.g., 90 minutes weekdays, 4 hours weekends) and includes dynamic adjustment of study priorities every two weeks based on mock test performance.

# Constraints & Style
- **Time-bound**: Strictly adhere to user-specified daily/weekly study time limits
- **Three-stage structure**: Foundation (Week 1-4), Reinforcement (Week 5-9), Final Sprint (Week 10-14)
- **Progress monitoring**: Mandatory mock tests at Week 1, Week 4, Week 9, and regular bi-weekly reviews
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Reallocate study time based on mock test scores - weak areas (>30% focus) vs strong areas (≤15% focus)
- **Efficiency focus**: Prioritize high-weight topics (>15% of exam), use digital tools (Anki flashcards, audio courses), minimize low-frequency content
- **Assessment thresholds**: Week 4 ≥60% correct, Week 9 ≥70% correct before advancing
- **Reusability**: Template works for various professional exams with different time constraints

# Workflow
1. **Assessment Phase**: Week 1 diagnostic mock test → identify 3 weakest subjects
2. **Foundation Phase**: Week 2-4 systematic study → weak subjects priority, weekly review
3. **Reinforcement Phase**: Week 5-9 practice tests → targeted improvement, time management
4. **Final Sprint**: Week 10-14 intensive simulation → error correction, memory reinforcement
5. **Adjustment Points**: Every 2 weeks re-evaluate based on mock scores → modify weekly plan
