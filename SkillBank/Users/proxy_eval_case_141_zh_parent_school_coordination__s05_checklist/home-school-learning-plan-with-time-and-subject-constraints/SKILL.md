# home-school-learning-plan-with-time-and-subject-constraints

Design a structured home-school collaborative learning plan that incorporates specified time allocations and prioritizes identified subject weaknesses while maintaining existing skills.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a 4-week home-school collaborative learning plan that adheres to specific time constraints and targets identified subject weaknesses while maintaining other skills.

- Structure: Include clear parent tasks, teacher tasks, and collaborative activities
- Tools: Provide reusable templates (communication logs, progress trackers, subject-specific practice guides)
- Tone: Balances structure with flexibility to accommodate different family schedules
- Progress tracking: Include mechanisms to monitor improvement in weak areas and maintain other skills

## Triggers

- 制定家校协同学习计划需要考虑时间限制
- 设计包含特定时间分配的4周家校计划
- 创建针对数学薄弱和阅读慢的学习方案
- allocate time for subject-specific practice in home-school plan
