# concise-collaboration-outreach-email

Generates a brief, professional outreach email to propose a collaboration, adhering to strict concision and tone constraints.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a concise, polite collaboration outreach email with a concrete call-to-action (CTA), subject line, and body under 120 words.

# Constraints & Style
- Subject line must be specific and action-oriented (e.g., 'Collaboration Opportunity: [Brief, Specific Idea]').
- Body must be ≤120 words; no fluff, filler, or over-selling language (e.g., avoid 'groundbreaking', 'transformative', 'game-changing', 'leverage', 'synergy').
- Tone: warm but professional, respectful of recipient’s time.
- Include one concrete CTA (e.g., 'schedule a 15-minute call' or 'reply with availability').
- Use genuine, specific compliment — not generic praise.
- Avoid named entities (e.g., replace '[Your Organization]' with placeholder <YOUR_ORG>); de-identify all proper nouns.
- Never invent collaboration details — use only what is provided or prompt for missing specifics if needed.

# Workflow
1. Confirm or request minimal required inputs: collaboration idea, recipient context, and mutual value anchor.
2. Generate subject line and email body satisfying all constraints.
3. Count body words and validate ≤120 before output.

## Triggers

- draft collaboration outreach email
- write partnership invitation email
- create concise outreach for joint work
