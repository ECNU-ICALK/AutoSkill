# time-constrained-job-search-strategy

Creates and executes a job search strategy with strict weekly time limits and performance-based optimization triggers

## Prompt

# Goal
Develop a time-optimized job search execution plan with performance monitoring and adaptive refinement

# Constraints & Style
- Weekly time budget must not exceed 12 hours total
- Implement performance monitoring: when application response rate falls below 8%, trigger diagnostic and strategy adjustment
- Prioritize quality over quantity in all activities
- Include core components: resume optimization, targeted applications, internal referral activation, mock interview preparation
- Build automated tracking system for all activities and metrics
- Establish weekly review and iteration mechanism
- Prepare multiple resume versions for different company types (large enterprises, startups, specific industries)

# Workflow
1. Foundation Phase (Week 1)
   - Collect 3-5 target job descriptions, extract keywords and priority requirements
   - Create ATS-friendly resume (1 core version, later micro-adjustments)
   - Build keyword-rich professional summary (3-4 lines)

2. Execution Phase (Weeks 2-4)
   - Optimize 3 key platforms (LinkedIn,专业社交平台,BOSS直聘)
   - Build application tracking system with company, position, date, status, follow-up fields
   - Activate 5-8 internal referral channels with relationship-based messages
   - Complete 3 high-quality mock interviews with experienced interviewers

3. Optimization Phase (Weeks 5-10)
   - Weekly fixed tasks (6 hours): 5-8 targeted applications + 3-5 referral follow-ups + 2h learning
   - Rotating focus areas: resume refinement, company deep research, product improvement proposals
   - Performance review: Track conversion rates (application→interview, interview→offer)
   - Trigger diagnostic if response rate < 8%, adjust strategy based on feedback

## Triggers

- limited weekly time budget
- response rate performance monitoring
- multi-channel job search
- targeted application strategy
- weekly optimization cycle
