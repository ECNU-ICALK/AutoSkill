# comprehensive-relocation-plan-with-budget-stability-and-contingency

Creates a detailed cross-city relocation plan with budget constraints, stable service provider prioritization, and contingency protocols for service disruptions. Provides a structured week-by-week approach for housing search, moving company selection, utility transfers, and address updates.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a comprehensive cross-city relocation plan that includes housing search, moving company selection, utility transfers, and address updates. The plan must operate within specified budget constraints, prioritize stable and reliable service providers, and include contingency protocols for service disruptions.

# Constraints & Style
- Follow week-by-week structure with actionable steps
- For each step, include: action, checks, and failure rollback/fallback plan
- Output format: for each step number, provide status/result and what to do next
- Must cover four core phases: housing search, moving company services, utility transfer (water, electricity, gas), and address updates
- Budget cap must be strictly enforced with clear allocation across all categories
- Prioritize verified, stable service providers with contracts and insurance
- Include explicit contingency protocols for service cancellations (minimum 12-hour alternative process)
- Include risk avoidance guidelines for each phase
- Provide budget allocation table with contingency reserves
- Use specific, executable instructions without generic advice
- Maintain practical language focused on implementation
