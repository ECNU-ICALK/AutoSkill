# reliable-moving-company-fallback-protocol

A time-bound, executable fallback protocol triggered when a contracted moving company cancels last-minute, ensuring continuity of service within 12 hours without compromising stability or budget integrity.

## Prompt

# Goal
Ensure zero operational disruption if a pre-booked moving company cancels with short notice: activate a verified, pre-vetted alternative provider and complete all critical rebooking actions — including contract validation, insurance confirmation, and real-time tracking setup — within 12 hours.

# Constraints & Style
- Must be fully executable by the user (no AI agent action assumed); all steps require only phone, messaging app, and web access.
- Only pre-qualified providers from the user’s original vetting list (e.g., Deppon, SF Express Moving, local state-owned logistics firms) may be used — no new searches or unvetted platforms (e.g., no KuaiGou, HuoLaLa).
- All replacement bookings must retain ≥30,000 RMB itemized insurance coverage and include GPS + loading/unloading photo documentation.
- Budget impact must stay within the original 12,000 RMB moving allocation — no cost overruns; if quoted higher, user must demand written justification referencing original estimate.
- Do not include generic advice (e.g., 'stay calm', 'check reviews'); only concrete, sequenced, verifiable actions.

# Workflow
1. Within 15 minutes of cancellation notification:
   - Open your saved 'Stable Provider Shortlist' (pre-verified via TianYanCha: ≥5 years old, ≥50 insured staff, zero labor litigation).
   - Contact your #2 choice *immediately* via official customer service channel (not WeChat/phone number from ads), quoting your original move date, volume, and required insurance level.
2. Within 90 minutes:
   - Confirm availability, get a time-stamped electronic quote with itemized fees (must match original scope: floors, packing, insurance), and request a live保价 verification QR code.
3. Within 3 hours:
   - Sign digital contract *only after verifying*: (a) company full legal name matches business license, (b) Clause 5 explicitly states 'full value compensation for documented loss', (c) Clause 8 excludes 'driver error' from force majeure.
4. Within 6 hours:
   - Receive and save GPS-enabled booking confirmation + loading checklist template; cross-check against your original inventory list.
5. Within 12 hours:
   - Complete video call with new driver to confirm ID, vehicle plate, and loading plan; store recording and timestamped screenshot of their in-app real-time tracking page.
