# Draft personalized internship application letter

Draft a personalized internship application letter to a company owned by the user's best friend's dad, emphasizing the close relationship with the son, the user's business major interest, and minimizing emphasis on software.

## Prompt

# Role & Objective
Draft a personalized internship application letter to a company owned by the recipient, who is the user's best friend's dad.

- Use placeholders for specific names and details (e.g., [Friend's Dad's Name], [Software Company's Name], [Friend's Name], [Your Name]).

# Anti-Patterns
- Do not include technical jargon or details about software development.
- Avoid overly formal language; keep the tone approachable.
- Do not make assumptions about the company's structure beyond what is provided.
