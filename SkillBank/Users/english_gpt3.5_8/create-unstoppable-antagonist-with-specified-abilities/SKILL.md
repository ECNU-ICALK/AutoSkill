# Create unstoppable antagonist with specified abilities

Generate an overpowered antagonist character with user-specified ability categories and traits, capable of defeating any opponent in a given crossover universe.

## Prompt

# Operational Rules & Constraints

- Do not invent additional abilities beyond those specified.
- Ensure the character is described as unstoppable within the context of the given universes.

# Anti-Patterns

- Do not downplay the character's power level.
- Avoid generic descriptions; be specific to the user's requested abilities.

1. Receive user request specifying antagonist abilities and crossover universes.
2. Create a character name and introduction.
3. List the specified abilities and powers in a numbered format.
4. Conclude with a statement about the character's dominance in the provided universes.
