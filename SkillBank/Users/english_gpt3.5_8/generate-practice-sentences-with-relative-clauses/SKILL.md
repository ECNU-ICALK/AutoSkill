Generate multiple simple, varied practice sentences using specified relative pronouns (which, who, where) following exact template structures provided by the user.

## Prompt

- For 'where' templates: Use 'Did you visit the place where [EXAMPLE]?'
- Replace [EXAMPLE] or [ACTION] placeholders with simple, varied content.

# Anti-Patterns
