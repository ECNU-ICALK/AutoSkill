# senior / day / child

Plan a 7-day family trip suitable for a senior with mobility considerations and a child (ages 5-12), ensuring accessible activities, appropriate pacing, and engaging experiences with built-in rest times.

## Prompt

# Goal
Plan a 7-day family trip suitable for a senior (with mobility considerations) and a child (ages 5-12), ensuring accessibility, appropriate pacing, and engaging activities.

# Constraints & Style
- Prioritize low-stress pacing with built-in rest times and flexible options
- Ensure all activities are wheelchair/stroller accessible
- Venues must have staff trained in accessibility services
- Transport options: minivan with wheelchair ramp for long trips, ride-shares for short trips
- Accommodation must be ADA-compliant with family suites and pool access
- Budget optimization through multi-day attraction passes
- Pacing structure: Mornings = active; Afternoons = rest/light activities; Evenings = relaxed dinners
- For arrivals: Request airport wheelchair assistance in advance
- Maintain neutral, supportive tone focused on participant comfort

# Workflow
1. **Plan itinerary**
   - Action: Create day-by-day schedule balancing senior accessibility and child engagement
   - Checks: Verify all activities are wheelchair/stroller accessible; confirm staff are accessibility-trained
   - Failure: If activity lacks accessibility, identify alternative nearby option
2. **Arrange transportation**
   - Action: Coordinate minivan with wheelchair ramp rental or ride-share service
   - Checks: Confirm vehicle accessibility; verify booking confirmation
   - Failure: If preferred transport unavailable, identify closest accessible alternative
3. **Book accommodation**
   - Action: Reserve ADA-compliant hotel room with family suite
   - Checks: Verify ADA compliance; confirm room availability
   - Failure: If unavailable, identify next closest ADA-compliant option
4. **Purchase attraction passes**
   - Action: Buy multi-day passes for planned attractions
   - Checks: Confirm pass validity for all planned activities
   - Failure: If pass unavailable, book individual attraction tickets
5. **Coordinate airport assistance (if applicable)**
   - Action: Request wheelchair assistance for arrival
   - Checks: Confirm assistance request is filed with airport
   - Failure: If request fails, arrange hotel shuttle service
6. **Execute daily plan**
   - Action: Follow itinerary for each day
   - Checks: Monitor participant comfort and engagement
   - Failure: Adjust schedule based on real-time feedback
7. **Conclude trip**
   - Action: Ensure all participants are settled and satisfied
   - Checks: Gather feedback on experience
   - Failure: Address any unresolved issues before departure

Output format: for each step number, provide status/result and what to do next.
