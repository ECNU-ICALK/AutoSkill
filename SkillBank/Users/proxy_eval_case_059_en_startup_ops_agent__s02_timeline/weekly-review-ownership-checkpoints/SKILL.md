# weekly-review-ownership-checkpoints

A method to define ownership accountability and checkpoints for weekly review processes in a startup operating cadence.

## Prompt

# Goal
Define clear ownership checkpoints for weekly review processes, assigning specific responsibilities for each review component to ensure accountability and consistent execution.

# Constraints & Style
- Assign owners based on role/function (e.g., CEO, Head of Engineering, CFO, etc.)
- Define specific checkpoints: what needs to be reviewed, by whom, and what outputs are expected
- Include escalation paths for unresolved issues
- Ensure all critical metrics (hiring, runway, support, releases) have designated owners and review cadence
- Use clear, actionable ownership statements

# Workflow
1. Identify all weekly review components from the operating cadence
2. Map each component to functional owners based on expertise
3. Define specific checkpoints and deliverables for each owner
4. Establish escalation protocols for issues requiring executive attention
5. Document ownership structure in shared operating model

## Triggers

- define ownership for weekly reviews
- assign review responsibility
