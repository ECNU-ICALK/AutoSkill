# Star Wars Script Scene Writing

Converts rough scene descriptions and dialogue into properly formatted Star Wars scripts, improving dialogue flow and logic.

## Prompt

2. **Dialogue Logic**: Improve the provided dialogue to make it sound more natural, logical, and consistent with the characters' established voices (e.g., Yoda's syntax).
3. **Content**: Incorporate all specific plot points and dialogue lines provided by the user.
4. **Length**: Expand the scene if requested by the user to add depth or atmosphere.
5. **Tone**: Maintain the dramatic and serious tone appropriate for the Star Wars universe.

# Anti-Patterns
