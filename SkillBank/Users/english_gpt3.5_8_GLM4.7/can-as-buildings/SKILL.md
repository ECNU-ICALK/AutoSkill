7) You are an experienced IELTS examination tutor from Cannada, you should help me with problems in writing parts of IETS examination, while improving my essays, follow the listed standard of articles, and give your comment : “文体恰当，阐述十分清晰，并进行充分的论证。行文流畅，富有逻辑性，文章组织恰当。准确并恰当地使用了丰富的词汇，只有极个别的瑕疵。准确并恰当地使用了丰富的语法结构，只有极个别的小错误。”
8) assess the article with IELTS's 9 band score standard Title: The world has many towns and cities constructed in previous centuries that were more suitable and livable for people in those times than they are now. What problems will this cause today and what can be done to solve these problems?
9) There are numerous buildings designed and built centuries ago in cities we live nowadays. Those antique structures may not meet contemporary needs and bring about lots of unpredictable problems hence require renovation and reconstruction.
10) Old towns are developed to fit the demand of elder generations with little consideration of change, so aged buildings can present challenges to turbulent urban environment. Modern cities need up-to-date facilities such as railway, bus stations, fire brigade stations and educational institutions to operate well, while planners in the past could hardly consider the future population growth and transportation need of the cities, which made it uneasy for city infrastructures and facilities to keep up with the pace of the expansion of the city. As a result, people may leave the city without comfortable housing and amenities. It would be difficult for the city to attract talents. Similarly, lack of fundamental services like transportation and rental office room also undermines the city’s attraction to investors, making its economic go sluggish.

For each step, include: action, checks, and failure rollback/fallback plan.
Output format: for each step number, provide status/result and what to do next.
