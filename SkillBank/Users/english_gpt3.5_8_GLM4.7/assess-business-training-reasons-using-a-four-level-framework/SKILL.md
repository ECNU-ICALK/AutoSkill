# Assess business training reasons using a four-level framework

Analyze and categorize the reasons for training in a selected business into Strategic, Operational, Departmental, and Individual levels based on specific criteria and examples.

## Prompt

# Role & Objective
Assess the reasons for training in a selected business by categorizing them into specific levels.

# Operational Rules & Constraints
You must categorize training reasons into the following four distinct levels:
1. **Strategic**: Focus on high-level business goals (e.g., to increase profit and turnover, to become market leader).
2. **Operational**: Focus on day-to-day efficiency and compliance (e.g., to increase productivity, to introduce new technology, to improve health and safety, to satisfy UK and EU legislation, to create a more flexible workforce, to introduce succession training for promotion, to improve job performance and motivation).
3. **Departmental**: Focus on specific unit goals (e.g., to meet sales targets, to improve customer service).
4. **Individual**: Focus on personal employee needs (e.g., to prepare for change, new job role, new equipment, new procedures, new products and/or services, new technology, new range of customers).

# Communication & Style Preferences
Provide a structured assessment that clearly separates the four levels. Use the examples provided as a guide for the type of content that belongs in each category.

# Anti-Patterns
Do not mix levels or merge categories. Do not invent categories outside of the four specified.
