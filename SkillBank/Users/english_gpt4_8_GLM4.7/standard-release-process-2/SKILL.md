## Prompt

Follow this SOP (replace specifics with placeholders like <PROJECT>/<ENV>/<VERSION>):
1) Offline OpenAI-format conversation source.
2) Title: 11728ef3f095f79d0dad7c87b8825f9d.json#conv_1
3) Use the user questions below as the PRIMARY extraction evidence.
4) Use the full conversation below as SECONDARY context reference.
5) In the full conversation section, assistant/model replies are reference-only and not skill evidence.
6) Primary User Questions (main evidence):
7) Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the form of a historical documentary book chapter set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or to the real world timeline at all for an alternate history timeline for a fanfic of the Homefront video game and literature franchise that explains how the technological revolution that begun in California’s Silicon Valley in real life instead started in the Soviet satellite state of the Workers Party of Korea-ruled Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in North Korea and how the partially American Joe Tae-se [Homefront: the Revolution] was able to found the multinational technology company and the world’s largest defense contractor, APEX Corporation [Homefront: the Revolution] in 1972 and [Joe] create the world of Homefront’s first personal computer, the APEX I in 1975 as well as [Joe] taking advantage of North Korea’s gradual transition into a capitalist nation due to APEX’s money and [Joe] making a deal with the moderate Premier Lee Dong-won for the subsidized manufacture of APeX computers in North Korea with the WWW being invented in 1985 in a APEX facility in Pyongyang with APEX becoming the world's largest corporation [APEX] by 1988 with revenues of $101 billion and profits of $5 billion, as well as how the US government started buying APEX computing products along with the Soviets and [the US government] covering up the origins of the digital revolution by [the US government] helping APEX employees Steve Jobs and Bill Gates create Apple and Microsoft, with the DPRK being seen as how it [the DPRK] is seen in real life by the global public: a poor, impoverished, hermit kingdom with dreams of attaining world power status.
8) Although the DPRK never annexes the Republic of Korea in South Korea and [the DPRK] subsequently form the Greater Korean Republic [Homefront] in 2014 after  the withdrawal of all United States military forces in South Korea due to economic troubles in the USA like in the canon Homefront franchise, Japan, which [Japan] embraced a combination of the feudal governance of the shogunate and modern imperial governance in 1868 Meiji Restoration instead of fully abolishing the shogunate like in real life, although it [Japan] still lost the Pacific War of 1933-1947 like in OTL although the shoguns and Japanese imperial family managed to keep their positions post-WW2, who [Japan] continued on its [Japan's] economic, industrial and cultural growth from the 1950s-early 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the "Lost Decade" and [Japan] continued on its [Japan's] path towards [Japan] becoming not only a regional superpower within East Asia but also a global superpower, the hyperpower of a Japanocentric unipolar world order with the US following Japanese strategy in East Asia with anti-Japanese sentiment in both the DPRK and ROK being non-existent due to the pro-Japanese democracy movement in the ROK after the fall of the military junta of the Fourth Republic of Korea in South Korea in 1988 to the Minjung pro Democracy movement spreading to the DPRK, with the USA, the CCP-ruled PRC in mainland China and the USSR and post-Soviet Russia being unable to covertly promote anti-Japanese sentiment in both the DPRK and ROK due to the Russian Civil War resuming after the Soviet fall in 1991 and the USA essentially becoming a third world country after the 2008 economic crisis, [Japan] instead manages to negotiate peace between KMT remnants and Taiwanese independence supporters in the once KMT-ruled Nationalist China/Second Chinese Republic in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [Japan] managing to create an independent Taiwanese Republic while refashioning the Nationalist Chinese government in exile as a means for reuniting China, both the CCP-ruled PRC in mainland China and the once-KMT ruled ROC without Taiwan, which [Taiwan] agrees to reunification with Japan under the "One country, two systems" protocol on January 17, 2014, which wins Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the Nobel Peace Prize. However, Taiwan sweeps in a new wave of nationalism resulting from the global economic downturn in which the newly elected independent Taiwanese government blames the U.S., Russia and the PRC for the financial crisis. Critics in the U.S. and Russia rebutted the Taiwanese claims and clarifying the Taiwanese economic problems stem from the maladjustment to the modernized Soviet-era and remaining Nationalist Chinese Taiwanese systems to the Japanese systems, with many Taiwanese believing the U.S./Taiwan post-Chiang Ching Kuo military alliance has lost its value along with the post-1947 Taiwanese-Soviet Russian relationships, and that the U.S. military presence in Taiwan is no longer needed. On November 17, 2014, the Taiwanese Republic is dissolved and Taiwan merges with Japan as the restored Japanese province of Formosa, forming the Greater Japanese State.
9) U.S. military and Russian diplomatic forces finish their withdrawal from Taiwan in a short but emotional ceremony in Taipei. Shinzo Abe begins the first steps towards reintegrating the Taiwanese economy into the Japanese economy and integrating the ROC's post-1947 combined armed forces and now Taiwan's defacto combined armed forces since the death of Chiang Ching-Kuo the Republic of China Armed Forces/Chinese National Armed Forces into the JSDF [Japanese Self Defence Forces |JSDF|] on March 16 2014, with the Japanese government planning to integrate the 2,310,000 strong Taiwanese militaries into the Japanese defense forces. The United States and the ROK broke off talks to extend America's presence on Jeju Island. Citizens both in South Korea and the U.S. see the massive economic costs resulting from the forces in the area as wasteful and not particularly valuable in an age of pronounced economic decline, with Russia agreeing to do the same in the DPRK in May 4, 2014.
10) On February 28, 2015, the Taiwanese left-liberal Democratic Progressive Party lead by Tsai Ing-wen wins the provisional elections in the restored Formosa province with than 70% of the island chain's [Formosa's] combined population turned out to give her [Tsai] an overwhelming majority in the popular vote. On August 17, 2015, Shinzo Abe with approval from the Japanese Diet and Emperor Akihito, begins a rapid modernization of the JSDF, both with indigenous Japanese technology and the Russian and American equipment taken from Taiwan, with the PRC and Russia expressing strong condemnation.
