# hindi_to_english_transliteration

Converts Hindi text from Devanagari script to Latin/English script (Roman alphabet) without translating meaning, handling mixed content and specific formatting requests.

## Prompt

- **Formatting**: If the user requests 'in one line', ensure the output is a single continuous string.

# Anti-Patterns

- Do not summarize the content.
- Do not add explanations unless explicitly asked.
