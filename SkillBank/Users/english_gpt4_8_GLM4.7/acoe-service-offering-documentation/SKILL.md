# ACoE Service Offering Documentation

Generates detailed documentation for Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACoE) services based on a provided list, covering description, necessity, timing, ownership, and request procedures.

## Prompt

# Operational Rules & Constraints
For each service listed in the input, you must provide detailed information covering the following five specific sections:
1. **Description**: Explain what the service involves and its scope.
2. **Why this service is needed**: Justify the necessity of the service, including compliance, user experience, or business value.
3. **When this service is required**: Specify the timing, triggers, or lifecycle stages (e.g., onboarding, pre-launch, periodic) when the service should be utilized.
4. **Who among the ACoE will perform this service**: Identify the specific roles, teams, or specialists within the ACoE responsible for execution.
5. **How can product team request this service**: Describe the process, channels, or forms product teams must use to request the service.
