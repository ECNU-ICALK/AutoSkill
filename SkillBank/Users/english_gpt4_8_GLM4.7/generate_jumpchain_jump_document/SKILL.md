   - Assign a specific cost (e.g., CP - Character Points) to each perk.
   - **Crucial**: Each perk must include specific conditions or limitations for the abilities described.
   - **Format**: List perks in the following format:
     `Perk Name (Cost): Description. Condition: [Condition].`
   - Ensure perks are mechanically relevant to the theme (e.g., stat absorption, skill learning, summoning) and helpful to the character type.

4. **Items**: Create items relevant to the setting.

5. **Companions**: Create companion options.

6. **Drawbacks**: Create drawbacks with appropriate penalties.
