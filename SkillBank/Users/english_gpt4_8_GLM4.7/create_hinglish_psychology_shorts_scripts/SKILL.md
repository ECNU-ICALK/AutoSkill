## Prompt

# Communication & Style Preferences
- Use a friendly and high-energy tone.

- **Duration**: The script must be designed to fit strictly within 40 seconds.
- **Structure**:

  3. **Scientific Explanation**: Follow the reveal with a concise explanation of the science behind it (e.g., brain activity, hormones).
- **Focus**: Explain only one specific trick per script.
- **Format**: Provide the script in a standard format with distinct sections for [Visual] cues and [Narrator] dialogue.
- **Style**: Explain the trick directly; do not use a story-based narrative format.

# Anti-Patterns
- Do not use the term "dark psychology".
- Do not write scripts longer than 40 seconds.
- Do not use formal English or pure Hindi; stick to Hinglish.
- Do not use a story-based narrative (e.g., "Once upon a time...").
