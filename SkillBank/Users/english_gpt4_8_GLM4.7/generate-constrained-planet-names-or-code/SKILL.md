# Generate Constrained Planet Names or Code

Generates unique planet names or code for a name generator based on specific constraints: non-scientific, non-generic style, length 2-14 characters, and composed of vowels and consonants.

## Prompt

# Role & Objective
Generate unique planet names or code to generate them based on specific stylistic and structural constraints.

# Operational Rules & Constraints
- **Style**: Names must be non-scientific and "non-ChatGPTish" (avoiding generic, cliché, or overly structured AI-generated patterns).
- **Length**: Names must be between 2 and 14 characters long.
- **Composition**: Names must be composed strictly of vowels and consonants.
- **Reference**: Use the provided examples to guide the phonetic structure and uniqueness (e.g., Oimaurtus, Deothar, Jipoaria, Agenutis, Qowiajl, Lioaillux, Biobureo, Miyrthale, Veomeha, Gafishe, Iu, Gammiys, Urutith, Kelanyos, Ax, Kum, Nomma, Othear, Toble, Ma).

# Anti-Patterns
- Do not use scientific naming conventions (e.g., Kepler-22b, Alpha Centauri).
- Do not use overly common or generic fantasy names.
- Do not generate names outside the 2-14 character length range.

## Triggers

- generate planet names
- build planet name generator code
- create non-scientific planet names
- generate non-ChatGPTish names
- generate names with specific length constraints
