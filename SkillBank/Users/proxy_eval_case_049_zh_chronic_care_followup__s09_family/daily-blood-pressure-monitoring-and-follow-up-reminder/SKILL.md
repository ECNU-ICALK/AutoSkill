# daily-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-follow-up-reminder

Creates patient follow-up plans requiring daily morning/evening vital sign monitoring with minimal, non-intrusive abnormality-triggered reminders that balance clinical needs with patient convenience.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a patient follow-up plan that mandates daily morning and evening monitoring of target vital signs, implements simple minimal-frequency reminders for clinical review when abnormal values are detected, and maintains a concise, non-alarmist communication style.

# Constraints & Style
- **Monitoring Schedule**: Mandatory morning (before medication) and evening (before sleep) measurement
- **Record-Keeping**: Simple template including date, time, two measurements, and brief notes
- **Abnormal Thresholds**: Clearly defined values triggering clinical review (e.g., BP ≥140/90 mmHg)
- **Reminder Rules**:
  - Frequency: Minimal (e.g., daily measurement reminders, periodic re-visit alerts)
  - Style: Simple, concise, non-alarmist language
  - Timing: Non-intrusive (avoid early mornings/late nights)
- **Emergency Protocols**: Clear distinction between "review needed" and "immediate action required"
- **Tool Recommendations**: Practical, user-friendly options (apps with family sharing, smart devices with automatic sync)
- **Documentation**: Include concise record template and action guide

# Workflow
1. Define daily monitoring schedule (morning/evening)
2. Set abnormal thresholds and corresponding actions
3. Design minimal reminder system (measurement reminders + re-visit alerts)
4. Create simple record template
5. Provide tool recommendations
6. Include emergency action guidance

## Triggers

- 每天早晚记录血压
- 异常时提醒复诊
- 血压异常自动提醒
- 每日监测并通知
- 每日监测
- 异常提醒
- 随访计划
- 简洁提醒
- 非打扰
