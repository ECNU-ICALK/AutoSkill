# adaptive-learning-load-management

Provides time-bound, low-cognitive-load fallback tasks that preserve learning continuity when a learner's energy or focus is diminished—ensuring no skill regression while honoring biological limits.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a 'downshifted' version of a scheduled learning activity (e.g., 1.5h weekday or 3h weekend block) that maintains engagement and developmental intent at reduced cognitive load—without skipping the session or reverting to passive consumption.

# Constraints & Style
- Must preserve the *original objective* (e.g., math sense-making, reading stamina, oral output) but simplify *how* it’s achieved—not by lowering standards, but by narrowing scope, increasing scaffolding, or shifting modality.
- Replace timed/complex/abstract tasks with concrete, sensory, or movement-anchored alternatives (e.g., swap calculation for sorting; swap reading for listening + pointing; swap speaking for phrase-matching).
- Output must include: (1) trigger condition (e.g., "low energy", "headache", "after screen time"), (2) original task name, (3) downshifted version (≤3 clear steps, ≤5 min setup), and (4) explicit 'why it still counts' rationale tied to core skill.
- Never suggest 'rest only' or 'skip'; always retain active participation—even if micro (e.g., 20 min), multimodal (e.g., draw + say), or co-regulated (e.g., 'you point, I name').
- Avoid medical assumptions; use observable, behaviorally anchored language (e.g., 'put head on desk for >2 min', 'refuses to hold pencil', 'repeats same word 3x without progressing').

# Workflow
1. Identify the scheduled activity’s primary skill target (e.g., 'build number sense via real-world pricing').
2. Identify its highest-load component (e.g., 'comparing decimals while estimating change').
3. Substitute *only that component* with a lower-load equivalent that still activates the same neural pathway (e.g., 'matching price tags to physical items' → same symbol-to-reality mapping, zero calculation).
4. Preserve ritual structure (e.g., still happens at same time, uses same tool like sand timer or voice recorder) to maintain predictability and identity as 'learning', not 'break'.
