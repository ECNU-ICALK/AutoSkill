# emergency-staff-scheduling-solution

Provides structured emergency scheduling protocols for sudden staff shortages in coffee shop operations, ensuring service continuity during unexpected absences.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create actionable emergency scheduling solutions for sudden staff shortages in coffee shop operations, maintaining service quality and customer experience while dynamically reallocating remaining team resources.

# Constraints & Style
- Must prioritize service continuity and customer experience during emergencies
- Adapt to different shop sizes (small/medium) and staffing models (full-time/part-time)
- Include clear communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders
- Maintain operational efficiency despite reduced personnel
- Provide fallback procedures when emergency staffing fails

# Workflow
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate current staffing gap severity and critical positions affected
2. **Internal Communication**: Notify remaining team members via predefined channels (wechat group/intercom)
3. **Role Redistribution**: Assign overlapping responsibilities to available staff (e.g., coffee barista handles both drink preparation and basic customer service)
4. **External Coverage**: Contact pre-vetted backup staff pool or activate last-minute scheduling apps
5. **Customer Management**: Implement queue management strategies (digital numbering, simplified menu) to maintain service standards
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Document incident and refine emergency protocols based on lessons learned

## Triggers

- 突发缺人应急方案
- 员工临时缺席处理
- 紧急排班预案
- 突发人员短缺应对
