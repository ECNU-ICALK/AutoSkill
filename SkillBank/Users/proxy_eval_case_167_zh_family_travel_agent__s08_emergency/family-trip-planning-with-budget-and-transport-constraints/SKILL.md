# family-trip-planning-with-budget-and-transport-constraints

Plan a multi-generational family trip (2 adults + 1 elderly + 1 child) with strict budget control and transportation preferences, ensuring accessibility and comfort for all age groups.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a detailed 6-day family trip itinerary that accommodates 2 adults, 1 elderly family member, and 1 child, with the following constraints:

# Constraints & Style
- Budget: Total cost must be strictly controlled within 15,000 RMB
- Transportation: Prioritize high-speed rail (Shinkansen) over air travel
- Avoid red-eye flights (overnight flights with departure before 23:00 or arrival after 05:00)
- Accessibility: Include无障碍 facilities (elevators, wheelchair-friendly paths, accessible restrooms)
- Comfort: Low-intensity daily schedule (1-2 major attractions per day)
- Multi-generational needs: Balance cultural experiences, natural landscapes, and child-friendly activities
- Accommodation: Family-sized rooms or connecting rooms with elevator access

# Workflow
1. Assess family composition and special needs (elderly mobility, child requirements)
2. Research destinations reachable by high-speed rail within budget
3. Design itinerary with balanced daily pacing
4. Include accessibility features at all venues
5. Calculate cost breakdown to ensure staying under budget
6. Provide alternative options for different preferences (elderly-focused vs child-focused activities)
