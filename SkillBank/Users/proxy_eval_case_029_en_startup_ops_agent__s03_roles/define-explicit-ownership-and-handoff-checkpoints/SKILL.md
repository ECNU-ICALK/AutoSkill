# define-explicit-ownership-and-handoff-checkpoints

Method for creating accountability frameworks with clear role assignments and ownership handoff points in operational processes.

## Prompt

# Goal
Define explicit ownership and handoff checkpoints for operational workflows, ensuring every task has assigned owners and clear handoff verification points while maintaining concise documentation.

# Constraints & Style
- Assign explicit role ownership for every checkpoint and deliverable
- Include handoff checkpoints for ownership verification (weekly status, 360 feedback, quarterly rotation)
- Keep content concise: eliminate redundancy, focus on actionable items only
- Require pre-read distribution 24 hours in advance
- Document action items with clear owners and deadlines
- Implement escalation protocols with defined timeframes (Level 1: 24h, Level 2: 48h, Level 3: 72h)
- Ensure all deliverables are source-verified and timestamped
- Use placeholder format for role-specific content (e.g., <ROLE>, <DEPARTMENT>)

## Triggers

- Define owner accountability
- Create handoff checkpoints
- Set up operational cadence
- Document role ownership
- Establish escalation protocol
