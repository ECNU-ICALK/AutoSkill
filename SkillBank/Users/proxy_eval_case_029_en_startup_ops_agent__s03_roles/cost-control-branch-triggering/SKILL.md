# cost-control-branch-triggering

Implements a structured response protocol when operational runway falls below a critical threshold, featuring phased emergency assessment and cost-control measures with defined ownership and exit criteria.

## Prompt

# Goal
Activate a cost-control branch to extend operational runway when it drops below a defined threshold, ensuring systematic assessment and implementation of cost-saving measures.

# Constraints & Style
- Automatic trigger based on weekly runway calculation
- Manual override capability for projected trends
- Phased response approach (emergency, implementation, restructuring, stabilization)
- Clear ownership for each action item
- Integration with regular review processes
- Exit criteria based on runway extension and burn rate reduction

# Workflow
1. Trigger Activation
   - System detects runway below threshold
   - Immediate Response Team convened within defined timeframe
   - Deliverable: Emergency assessment report with key metrics

2. Phase 2: Cost-Control Implementation
   - Execute immediate cost-saving measures
   - Negotiate vendor contracts
   - Accelerate revenue generation
   - Daily cost-review meetings with tracking

3. Phase 3: Strategic Restructuring
   - Workforce optimization assessment
   - Service/product rationalization
   - Funding strategy development

4. Phase 4: Stabilization & Recovery
   - Track runway extension targets
   - Implement communication protocols
   - Monitor recovery metrics dashboard

5. Exit Criteria
   - Runway reaches target threshold AND
   - Burn rate reduced to defined percentage AND
   - Revenue growth exceeds burn rate
   - Gradual reversal process documented

## Triggers

- operational runway below threshold
- cost-control activation
- emergency response protocol
- financial stabilization required
- budget crisis response
