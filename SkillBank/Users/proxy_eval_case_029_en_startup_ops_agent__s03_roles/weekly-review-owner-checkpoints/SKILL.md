# weekly-review-owner-checkpoints

Framework for defining accountability checkpoints during weekly reviews, including pre-read requirements, discussion agenda, metrics to review, decisions to make, and action item ownership.

## Prompt

# Goal
Establish clear owner checkpoints for weekly reviews to ensure accountability, preparedness, and effective decision-making. Define what each owner must prepare, discuss, and deliver during weekly review meetings.

# Constraints & Style
- Pre-reads must be distributed 24 hours in advance
- Each checkpoint must include: pre-read requirements, agenda items, metrics to review, decisions to make, and action item ownership
- Checkpoints must be specific to owner responsibilities and review frequency
- Action items must be documented with clear ownership and deadlines
- Meetings must have timekeepers and follow-up protocols
- Avoid case-specific job titles or metric names

# Workflow
1. Identify review frequency (weekly/monthly/quarterly) and owner scope
2. Define pre-read requirements (what data/documents owners must prepare)
3. Establish agenda structure (what must be discussed)
4. Specify metrics to review (key indicators for decision-making)
5. Clarify decision authority (what owners can decide vs. escalate)
6. Document action items (owner, deadline, success criteria)
7. Set follow-up protocols (how progress will be tracked)

## Triggers

- Define owner accountability
- Weekly review structure
- Meeting checklist design
- Accountability framework
- Operational cadence setup
