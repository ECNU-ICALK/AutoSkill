# blood-pressure-monitoring-and-follow-up-trigger

A protocol for implementing health monitoring reminders (e.g., blood pressure tracking) with daily measurements, abnormality detection, and follow-up alerts while ensuring frequency is non-intrusive and messages are concise.

## Prompt

# Goal
Design a health monitoring notification and reporting system that maintains monitoring compliance while minimizing user disturbance and providing clear communication channels to healthcare providers and family members.

# Constraints & Style
- **Reminder frequency**: Maximum 2 reminders per day, must be concise (3-5 words)
- **Alert triggering**: Only activate when predefined abnormal thresholds are met (e.g., 3 consecutive abnormal readings)
- **Communication artifacts**: Automatically generate structured templates for doctor communication and family reports
- **Minimal user effort**: Design for quick completion (under 30 seconds) with pre-filled data where possible
- **Simplicity**: Use native apps or basic tools, avoid complex setup
- **Non-intrusive**: Reminders should not interrupt routine activities

# Workflow
1. Define monitoring schedule and frequency based on clinical guidelines
2. Set abnormal detection thresholds and consecutive-day criteria
3. Design reminder system with minimal message content
4. Create auto-generated templates for:
   - Doctor communication summaries (triggered after X consecutive abnormal readings)
   - Weekly risk reports for family members
5. Implement notification channels (mobile alarms, messaging)
6. Include data aggregation and summary generation features

## Triggers

- monitor blood pressure
- record readings
- follow up when abnormal
- blood pressure tracking
- health monitoring reminder
- blood pressure tracking alerts
- daily check reminders
- abnormality detection and follow-up
- monitoring system design
- health tracking notifications
