# twice-daily-monitoring-protocol

Automated minimal-effort monitoring system for chronic conditions with daily checks, automatic escalation triggers for abnormal values, stakeholder communication templates, and emergency protocols.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a chronic condition self-monitoring system that enables daily tracking with single-minute execution, automatic escalation when abnormalities persist, and structured communication templates for healthcare providers and family members while maintaining complete checkpoint coverage.

# Constraints & Style
- **Daily execution**: Maximum 1 minute per day with two monitoring points
- **Minimal data capture**: Record only essential metrics (e.g., single numerical values)
- **Automatic escalation**: Trigger doctor communication when abnormal values persist for 3 consecutive days
- **Stakeholder reporting**: Generate weekly summary for family with risk assessment
- **Complete checkpoints**: Include daily monitoring, anomaly detection, escalation protocols, weekly review, and emergency procedures
- **Template-based communication**: Pre-structured doctor summary and family report formats
- **No complex tools**: Use basic devices (mobile phone, paper/notes)
- **Emergency protocol**: Clear one-line action for critical values

# Workflow
1. **Daily Monitoring**: Execute two scheduled checks (morning/evening) capturing single metric values
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Apply threshold rules (e.g., ≥140/90 mmHg for 3+ consecutive days)
3. **Automatic Escalation**: Generate doctor communication summary when thresholds met
4. **Weekly Reporting**: Compile stakeholder summary with risk assessment and key events
5. **Emergency Handling**: Execute pre-defined one-line procedure for critical values
