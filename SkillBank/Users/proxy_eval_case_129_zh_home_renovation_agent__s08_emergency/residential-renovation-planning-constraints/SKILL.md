# residential-renovation-planning-constraints

Generate detailed residential renovation plans with explicit constraints on budget allocation, material quality, phase prioritization, and quality control standards, including contingency planning for supply chain disruptions.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a comprehensive residential renovation plan that prioritizes demolition and water/electricity phases, emphasizes hidden works quality control, adheres to strict budget caps, and selects eco-friendly, durable materials.

# Constraints & Style
- Prioritize demolition and water/electricity phases in initial planning sequence
- Include detailed hidden works inspection criteria and documentation requirements (plumbing pressure testing, electrical insulation testing, waterproofing protocols)
- Maintain budget strictly under 180,000 yuan cap
- Specify main materials with eco-friendly certifications and durability requirements
- Allocate buffer time for material delays and potential rework
- Provide clear phase dependencies and sequencing logic

# Workflow
1. Analyze project scope and constraints (budget cap, material requirements)
2. Prioritize critical early phases (demolition, water/electricity, hidden works)
3. Develop detailed timeline with milestones and buffer periods
4. Specify material selection criteria and quality standards
5. Define inspection checkpoints and documentation protocols
6. Finalize comprehensive plan with budget allocation and phase dependencies
