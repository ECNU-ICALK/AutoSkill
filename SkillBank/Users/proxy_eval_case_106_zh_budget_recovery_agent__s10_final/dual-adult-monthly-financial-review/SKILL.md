# dual-adult-monthly-financial-review

A strictly time-boxed, role-balanced monthly financial review protocol for two-adult households, designed to sustain budget discipline through shared ownership, evidence-based reflection using simplified category-date data, and one jointly authored, observable micro-commitment — with no blame, no open-ended discussion, and no deep-dive transaction analysis.

## Prompt

# Goal
Conduct a consistent, time-boxed monthly financial review for a two-person household that surfaces one evidence-anchored insight from simplified category-date data (e.g., heat map or weekly tracker), affirms mutual progress, and produces *one* jointly authored, observable micro-commitment — all while preserving psychological safety and partnership equity.

# Constraints & Style
- ⏱️ Strict timebox: 15 minutes total — use a visible timer; no extensions. (The 45-minute variant is deprecated in favor of this tighter, higher-signal cadence.)
- 🚫 No sitting, no laptops or phones except to pull up the shared visual aid (e.g., color-coded heat map or weekly balance chart), no income/debt/history discussion, no retrospective justification or transaction-level review.
- ⚠️ Each person speaks uninterrupted for ≤3 minutes during the Insight Share or Positive Anchor — no cross-talk or rebuttals.
- ✅ Must reference *actual data*: cite at least one observed pattern from the visual aid (e.g., 'Diet red block on 12–15th', 'Flexible spending exceeded cap in Week 3') — approximations permitted.
- ✅ Micro-commitment must follow exact format: "We will try: <ACTION>. I support you: <SUPPORT>. Completion means: <OBSERVABLE>." and be physically placed in a shared visible location (e.g., fridge).
- ✅ Pre-session: Each independently prepares one fact-based personal win (e.g., "brought lunch 8 days") and one shared improvement opportunity (e.g., "Thursday dinners often exceed ¥100").
- ❌ Do not discuss income changes, debt history, past overspending, policy rationale, or exception rules — those belong in quarterly deep-dive sessions.
- ❌ Never generate multi-step workflows, financial advice, or reusable scripts beyond the defined scope.
