7) Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the form of a historical documentary book chapter set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or to the real world timeline at all, in which the Xinhai Revolution launched by the Han nationalist and Han supremacist Tongmenhui against the Manchu ruled Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire in 1911 and ending in 1912 with the fall of the Great Qing Empire stays true to its [the Xinhai's revolution's] goal of [what the Xinhai Revolution's goal was] “Overthrowing Qing, restore Ming” and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China maintains its [the Beiyang Goverment’s] role as a provisional government [the Beiyang Government] and regency state [the first Republic of China] for the restoration of the pre-Qing Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/"Ming dynasty" and the Ming dynasty’s imperial family, the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu in Han China proper despite [Beiyang China] being a protectorate [Beiyang China] of Imperial Japan, with the Qing Empire and the House of Aisin-Gioro surviving in Manchuria under Japanese protection, the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia ruled by the Bogd Khans becoming a satellite state of Imperial Japan instead of the Russian Empire. the Kumul Khanate in Xingjiang’s Hami prefecture expanding to rule over all of East Turkestan, and Tibet remaining independent under the Llamas. On 1 January 1916, the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu are formally restored in China with the new Chinese Emperor taking the regal name of Hongxian [Promote the Constitution |Hongxian|], with Song Jiaoren becoming the first Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty. Due to this, international loans for development, industrialization and railway construction flow into China, preventing the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post Qing Chinese history due to the restored imperial government [the Ming dynasty] being accepted by most of the Chinese population and Dr. Sun-Yat-Sen dying from a stray shot during Xinhai and Han Chinese Qing general Yuan Shikai dying while defending the Qing during Xinhai, preventing the modern warlord era of post-Qing Chinese history. Yunnan is allowed to be independent along with Guangxi and Guangdong, who [Guangxi and Guangdong] unite into a Cantonian federation.
8) Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: How exactly did the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China fulfill its [the Beiyang Government's] role as a regency state [the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China] and transitionary state [the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China] for the restoration of the monarchy [the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu] in post-Qing Han China and how did it [the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China] help develop and industrialize the nation [post-Qing Han China] with both loans for industrial development and industrial equipment from the USA and Western Europe along with Imperial Japan in preparation for the return of the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and what role did the Beiyang Government's legislative branch, the Bicameral National Assembly divided [the Beiyang Government's National Assembly] into a Senate and House of Representatives, [the National Assembly] play in this due to Song surviving both Dr. Sun Yat Sen and Yuan Shikai and [Song] being [Song] able to [Song] implement his [Song's] reforms and development?
9) Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: How exactly did the restoration of the monarchy [the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu] in post-Qing Han China go and how was it [the restoration of the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu as the government of post-Qing Han China] done with the approval of the National Assembly and the approval of the Chinese people through a democratic referendum? How did the coronation of Emperor Hongxian on the Dragon Throne in Beijing go and how was Song's implementation and [Song's] interpretation of Dr Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people:  nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people (or welfarism) used to get the Chinese people to support the restoration of the monarchy [the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu]?
10) Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: How exactly did the restored Great Ming State in post-Qing Han China transition towards a constitutional federalist absolute democratic royal imperial monarchy with free and fair, multi-party elections done via secret ballot and how did the Beiyang Government's five color flag end up remaining as the restored Ming's state flag while the Ming sun flag, a orange banner [the Ming sun flag] with a red dot in the center [of the Ming sun flag],  [the Ming sun flag] became the Chinese civil flag? Also how did the restored Great Ming State in post-Qing Han China maintain the Twelve Symbols national emblem as its national emblem while adding two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main emblem while also making the Han nationalist, Han supremacist political party and secret society founded by Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the White Sun with a yellow sun and [the restored Great Ming State] making the crossed 18-star iron blood flag the Chinese army flag?
