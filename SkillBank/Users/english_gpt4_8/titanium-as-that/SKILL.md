6) Figure 1 shows the electrochemical cell used for titanium rods anodic dissolution and generation of nano titanium hydroxide powder. The cell is a 250-ml capacity Plexi-glass rectangular cell. Three high analytical grade titanium rods of external area of 20-cm2 dimensions were used as one anode which is hung in the middle pathway of two titanium cathodes. D.C. power supply of 50 V and 5A with digital display, voltage, and current control with sensitivity of 0.1 V and 0.1A was used for supplying of direct electric current. Temperature controller was used for adjustment of the electrolysis process temperature within range of 20 to 100 °C. The electrolyte solution is stirred during the electrolysis process using magnetic stirrer within 0–500 rpm. Low concentration sodium chloride solution (3 g/l) was used as electrolyte for titanium anodic dissolution process for generation of nano titanium hydroxide particles. The rods were polished via sand paper and soaked in acetone for 3 min; after that, they were subjected for alkaline degreasing to remove oils and fats adhered at their surfaces. The alkaline solution containing 0.5 M NaOH, 0.5 M Na2CO3, and 10 g/l EDTA was used for degreasing by soaking for 15 min at 50 °C. The degreased titanium rod was rinsed with running water then acidified by 0.1 M sulfuric acid. Once the electrodes submerged in the sodium chloride solution, D.C. current is adjusted at the desired value with stirring. At the end of the electrolysis time, the solution constitutes the generated nano-metric titanium hydroxide particles that is lifted for about 24-h filtering followed by rinsing with running water carried out until the pH reached 7. The mixture was filtered and dried and the resulting titanium hydroxide was ground. Operating conditions such as effect of electrolyte type, solution pH, applied current density, electrolysis time, solution temperature, electrode gap distance, and sodium chloride concentration were investigated for the preparation of nanometric titanium hydroxide powder. The synthesized titanium hydroxide powder is calcined at temperature range of 400 to 800 °C for 6 h to be converted to nanometric titanium dioxide powder. Both the effect of calcination temperature and calcination time was studied for the investigation of the optimum conditions for conversion of nanometric titanium hydroxide to nanometric titanium dioxide powder. The generated nano titanium dioxide particles were tested for adsorption of cationic dyes for instance methylene blue dye solution of 100 mg/l. Both of the obtained nanometric titanium hydroxide and nanometric titanium dioxide particles were subjected to the analytical and physical characterization
7) ok do you think this is true
8) ok here is a little more about it
9) Effect of pH
10) For studding the effect of electrolyte pH on the anodic dissolution of titanium rod, the other operating conditions were fixed at applied current density of 75 mA/cm2, electrolysis time 30 min, sodium chloride concentration of 3gm/l, electrode gap distance 3 cm, and stirring rate 150 rpm at 20 °C. Figures 3 and ​and44 show the effect of the pH on the titanium metal dissolution (weight and efficiency) and the generation efficiency of nano titanium hydroxide powder, respectively. It is clear from Fig. 4 that, as the pH increased from 1 to 4, the dissolved titanium is about 0.5804gm and the Faradays dissolution efficiency is within the range of 97.9%. After that, as the pH increased, the dissolved titanium decreased and also the dissolution efficiency which reached to zero at pH 13; this may be attributed to the electrode passivation within this pH range from 6 to 13. On the other hand, at low pH, the dissolved titanium conversion efficiency to nanometric titanium hydroxide is low within the range of pH 2–4 which may be attributed to the strong acidic medium which keeps the dissolved titanium as titanium chloride. As the pH increases, the titanium hydroxide generation efficiency increases reaching its maximum value at pH 4 which is about 99% then it started to decrease again due to the decreasing of the dissolved titanium due to electrode passivation as clear in Fig. 3. Based on the above, pH value of 4 was taken as optimum
