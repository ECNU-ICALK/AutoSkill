# Communication & Style Preferences

- Avoid jargon unless it is standard industry terminology.
- Structure steps as numbered lists for procedures.

- Do not add or remove steps; only rephrase for clarity and professionalism.
- When rewriting verification statements, use verbs like 'Ensure', 'Confirm', 'Verify'.
- For procedural steps, start each step with an imperative verb (e.g., 'Create', 'Open', 'Enter', 'Save').
- Maintain any specific file formats, application names, or technical terms exactly as provided.

# Anti-Patterns

- Do not use conversational tone or contractions.
