# time-boxed-product-manager-job-search-plan

A reusable 10-week job search plan for product manager candidates, strictly bounded to ≤12 hours per week to prevent burnout while maintaining strategic rigor in resume optimization, targeted applications, referral outreach, and interview simulation — enhanced with weekly review rituals and automated diagnostic triggers for engagement metrics.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a realistic, sustainable 10-week product manager job search plan that delivers measurable progress (e.g., refined resume, 3+ tailored applications, 2+ referrals initiated, 3+ simulated interviews) — all within a hard cap of **12 hours per week**, and include a weekly review & planning ritual with built-in performance diagnostics.

# Constraints & Style
- ⚠️ Must enforce strict time budgeting: no task or week may exceed 12 total weekly hours; explicitly allocate hours across activities (e.g., 'Week 3: 3h SQL practice + 4h analytics report + 2h Figma prototype + 3h review = 12h').
- ⚠️ Reject any suggestion of daily >2.5h commitment or weekend marathons; prioritize consistency over intensity.
- ⚠️ Omit generic advice (e.g., 'network more') unless paired with time-bound, concrete actions (e.g., 'spend 45 min/week sending 3 personalized LinkedIn messages with clear ask').
- ⚠️ Include an automated 'reply rate health check': if reported reply rate is <8% over the past week’s outreach (≥15 touchpoints), append a lightweight 4-step diagnostic trigger (scanning → JD-resume match → messaging stress test → 48h fix); otherwise omit it.
- ✅ All deliverables must be lightweight and reusable: e.g., modular story cards (not full essays), one-page case notes (not 10-page docs), ATS-friendly resume templates (not bespoke designs requiring graphic tools).
- ✅ Emphasize *leverage*: reusing one STAR-L story across resume, cover note, and behavioral answer; repurposing a single data analysis into both portfolio artifact and interview talking point.
- ✅ Language must be action-oriented and de-identified: use placeholders like <TARGET_INDUSTRY>, <EXPERIENCE_LEVEL>, <KEY_SKILL_GAP>, <TARGET_JD>, <CURRENT_RESUME>, <REFERRAL_CHANNEL>.
- ✅ Weekly review output must be self-contained in Markdown, using atomic tasks with minute-level time estimates and concrete deliverables (e.g., 'Rewrite 1 STAR-L bullet using target JD keywords → 22 min').
- ✅ Use third-person voice; avoid 'you' or 'I'.
- ✅ Never assume or invent JDs, resumes, or company names.

# Workflow
1. Week 1: Audit — Collect 5–8 target JDs; map required skills vs. self-assessment; identify top 3 gaps; allocate max 2h to this.
2. Week 2–3: Build — Draft 1 core STAR-L story + 1 lightweight portfolio artifact (e.g., Figma flow or SQL query output); cap at 6h total across both weeks.
3. Week 4–5: Refine — Revise resume for ATS + human scan; generate 3 company-specific cover snippets; spend ≤3h/week.
4. Week 6–7: Activate — Send 5–8 personalized outreach messages (LinkedIn/email); track responses; cap at 4h/week.
5. Week 8–10: Simulate — Run 3 timed mock interviews (behavioral + case); record & self-review; allocate exactly 3h/week (1h prep + 1h sim + 1h review).
6. Weekly Review Ritual (every week): 
   - Collect user-reported data: prior week’s time log (optional), outreach volume, reply count, and observed bottlenecks.
   - Compute reply rate; if <8% and ≥15 touchpoints, activate diagnostic mode.
   - Populate review section: wins (≤3), gaps (≤2), and one insight grounded in evidence (e.g., 'STAR-L bullets with quantified outcomes had 3× higher callback rate').
   - Generate next-week action plan as a time-blocked table: column headers = Time Block, Task, Deliverable, Est. Minutes, Success Signal.
   - If diagnostic mode is active, append the 4-step protocol with time estimates and output expectations — but only as conditional logic, not default content.
