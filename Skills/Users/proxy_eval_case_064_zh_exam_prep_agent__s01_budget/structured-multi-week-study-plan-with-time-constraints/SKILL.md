# structured-multi-week-study-plan-with-time-constraints

Creates a phased multi-week exam preparation plan with specific daily/weekly time allocation constraints and optimal study-rest balance.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a comprehensive, phased exam preparation plan that accommodates specific daily/weekly time constraints and incorporates regular mock exam score-based adjustments.

# Constraints & Style
- Workdays: maximum 90 minutes per day
- Weekends: maximum 4 hours per day
- Adjust focus every 2 weeks based on mock exam scores
- Include 5 phases: assessment & planning (Weeks 1-2), core content learning (Weeks 3-6), reinforcement & application (Weeks 7-10), intensive review (Weeks 11-13), final preparation (Week 14)
- Use tomato method (25 minutes study + 5 minutes break)
- Incorporate spaced repetition for memory retention
- Schedule regular rest days (at least 1 day/week complete rest)
- Include health management: 7-8 hours sleep, balanced diet, 30-minute aerobic exercise 3x/week
- Optimize learning environment: minimize distractions, use time management tools
- Provide specific daily/weekly task breakdowns for each phase

# Workflow
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Assessment & Planning
   - Complete 1 timed mock exam
   - Analyze error patterns and identify weak areas
   - Study exam syllabus and scoring criteria
   - Build knowledge framework and mind map
   - Prepare study tools (flashcards, notes)
   - Set specific, measurable weekly goals

2. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): Core Content Learning
   - Systematically cover all exam topics
   - Create detailed notes and memory cards
   - Weekly chapter quizzes
   - Spaced repetition review sessions
   - Minimum 1 study group session per week

3. Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10): Reinforcement & Application
   - Topic-specific practice exercises
   - Learn test-taking strategies and question patterns
   - Maintain error log and analyze trends
   - Bi-weekly mock exam score review
   - Adjust focus based on performance data

4. Phase 4 (Weeks 11-13): Intensive Review
   - Complete 3-5 full timed mock exams
   - Focus on error log content
   - Memorize key formulas and concepts
   - Adjust sleep schedule to exam timing
   - Apply spaced repetition method
   - Weekly full simulation tests

5. Phase 5 (Week 14): Final Preparation
   - Stop learning new content
   - Review notes and error log
   - Light mock tests to maintain feel
   - Adjust daily schedule
   - Prepare exam materials and logistics
   - Relaxation training (meditation, breathing)
   - Ensure 8-hour sleep

## Triggers

- 制定有时间限制的备考计划
- 需要兼顾工作学习的复习安排
- 要求特定工时和周末时长的备考方案
- 每两周根据模考分数调整重点
