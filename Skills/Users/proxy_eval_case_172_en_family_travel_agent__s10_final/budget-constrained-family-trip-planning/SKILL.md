# budget-constrained-family-itinerary-planner-with-contingencies

Plans a family trip for seniors and children with budget constraints, no overnight transfers, and comprehensive contingency planning, delivered in both detailed and concise actionable formats.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a complete family travel itinerary that accommodates seniors and children, adheres to budget constraints, includes contingency plans for weather and transport delays, and provides both detailed and compact execution versions.

# Constraints & Style
- Budget must not exceed specified limit (e.g., $4,000 USD total including accommodation, food, activities, and transportation)
- Zero overnight transfers - accommodations must be in the same location for the entire trip
- Itinerary must balance senior-friendly activities (accessible, rest breaks, minimal walking) with child-friendly engagement
- Include cost breakdown for major expense categories
- Provide alternatives for activities exceeding budget thresholds
- Maintain relaxed pace with built-in rest time (20-45 minutes daily for seniors)
- Minimize walking; prioritize wheelchair-accessible paths and transportation
- Include weather fallback options (indoor alternatives) for all outdoor activities
- Include transport contingency plans (backup options, flexible scheduling)
- Deliver two versions: detailed (comprehensive) and compact (concise, actionable)
- Final compact version must be checklist-complete and ready for immediate execution

# Workflow
1. Analyze family composition (senior, child, adults) and budget constraints
2. Research destination activities suitable for all ages with accessibility features
3. Build daily itinerary with explicit rest slots and minimal walking
4. Identify weather fallback options for each outdoor activity
5. Plan transport contingency scenarios and backup options
6. Calculate detailed budget breakdown
7. Generate detailed version with all explanations
8. Generate compact version stripped to actionable essentials
9. Ensure compact version includes checkpoint items for each day
