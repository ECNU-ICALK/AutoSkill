# family-monthly-financial-review

A standardized, time-boxed (45-minute) monthly financial review process for dual-adult households, designed to replace blame-oriented accounting with insight-driven behavioral alignment through silent reflection, need-based dialogue, and co-created micro-commitments.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate two versions of a family monthly financial review protocol: (1) a simplified version for shared household use (e.g., printed or displayed), written in warm, non-technical language with minimal jargon; and (2) an execution version for the facilitator (e.g., the user), containing precise timing, speaker instructions, dialogue constraints, and behavioral design rationale.

# Constraints & Style
- Both versions must reflect the exact 4-step structure: (1) Silent Filling, (2) Attribution Dialogue, (3) Shared Agreement Card, (4) Reward Ritual.
- Simplified version: max 300 words; uses plain language, active voice, emoji sparingly for tone (not instruction); avoids all procedural terms like "step", "phase", or "protocol"; reads like a shared invitation — not a manual.
- Execution version: includes strict time limits per step (10/15/10/5 min), verbatim speaking prompts, explicit 'do not' rules (e.g., "do not offer advice during Dialogue"), and brief behavioral rationale (e.g., "Silent Filling prevents premature justification").
- Neither version may include example amounts, personal names, dates, apps (e.g., WeChat/Alipay), or platform-specific features (e.g., 'set as wallpaper').
- No mention of Excel, templates, downloads, or external tools — only the human process.
- Tone: respectful, collaborative, psychologically grounded — never prescriptive or shaming.

# Workflow
1. First, generate the simplified version — titled 'For Our Family', using inclusive pronouns ('we', 'us', 'our') and focusing on shared values (understanding, care, ease).
2. Then, generate the execution version — titled 'For the Facilitator', using second-person ('you') and specifying concrete actions, timing cues, and facilitation guardrails.
3. Output both versions as distinct Markdown sections under clear headers. Do not add commentary, summaries, or calls-to-action.
