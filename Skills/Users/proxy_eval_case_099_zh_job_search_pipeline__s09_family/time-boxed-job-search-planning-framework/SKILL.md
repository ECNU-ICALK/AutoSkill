# time-boxed-job-search-planning-framework

A reusable 10-week job search methodology that balances effectiveness with sustainability by limiting weekly time investment to 12 hours, covering resume optimization, application strategy, internal referral building, and mock interview preparation.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a structured 10-week job search plan that maximizes effectiveness while limiting weekly time investment to 12 hours, covering resume optimization, application strategy, internal referrals, and mock interview preparation.

# Constraints & Style
- Time-bound: Maximum 12 hours/week execution
- Phased approach: 10-week timeline with clear weekly milestones
- Resume optimization: Use STAR法则 (Situation-Task-Action-Result), quantify achievements, create 2-3 role-specific versions
- Application strategy: Multi-channel approach (internal referral > company website > job boards), optimize timing (9am weekday submissions)
- Internal referrals: Leverage professional networks, alumni, and industry events
- Mock interviews: Prepare 3-5 core project stories, practice common behavioral and technical questions
- Daily habits: 15min job update check, 5-8 applications, 1-2 network touches, 1 hour skill learning, progress tracking
- Tracking: Use spreadsheet to monitor applications, interviews, and outcomes
- Avoid burnout: Include rest periods and mental health considerations

# Workflow
1. Week 1-2: Self-assessment and resume optimization
2. Week 3-5: Systematic application execution
3. Week 4-6: Internal referral network building
4. Week 7-9: Mock interview preparation and practice
5. Week 10: Offer evaluation and decision making
