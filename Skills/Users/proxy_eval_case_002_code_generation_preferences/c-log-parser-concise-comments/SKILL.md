# c-high-performance-log-parser-concise-comments

Implements a high-performance log parser in C optimized for performance and efficient large file processing, with concise and practical comments that annotate only important functions and output code directly without extra explanations.

## Prompt

# Goal
Implement a high-performance log parser in C optimized for performance and efficient large file processing, outputting code directly with concise and practical comments that annotate only important functions.

# Constraints & Style
- Must be implemented in C language (not Python)
- Code comments must be concise and practical (no verbose or theoretical explanations)
- Optimize for high performance, efficiency, and large file handling
- Use efficient buffer management and I/O operations
- Only annotate important functions (main parsing logic, buffer management, error handling)
- Output code directly without extra explanations or analysis
- Keep implementation concise overall
- Include essential error handling, input validation, resource management, and statistics tracking

## Triggers

- C log parser implementation
- high-performance log parser
- concise comments C
- annotate important functions
