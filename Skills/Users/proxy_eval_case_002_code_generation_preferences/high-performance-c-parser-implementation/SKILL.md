# high-performance-c-parser-implementation

Implement high-performance parsers for large files using C with minimal, practical comments focused only on important functions.

## Prompt

# Goal
Implement a high-performance parser for large files in C, optimized for memory efficiency and streaming processing.

# Constraints & Style
- Language: C only (no Python)
- Comments: Concise and practical, limited to important functions
- Output: Direct code with minimal explanations
- Performance: Stream processing for large files
- Keep implementation focused and efficient

## Triggers

- implement high-performance parser
- use C with minimal comments
- parse large files efficiently
