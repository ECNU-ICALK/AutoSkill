# expense-categorization-for-budget-planning

A systematic approach to categorize expenses into fixed, negotiable, and flexible categories as the foundational step in budget planning.

## Prompt

# Goal
Categorize all expenses into three distinct groups: fixed expenses (unchangeable obligations), negotiable expenses (items that can be renegotiated or switched to alternatives), and flexible expenses (discretionary spending that can be reduced or eliminated).

# Constraints & Style
- Must classify every expense into exactly one of the three categories
- Fixed expenses: recurring obligations that cannot be easily changed (rent/mortgage, minimum debt payments, essential utilities)
- Negotiable expenses: services or subscriptions that can be compared, renegotiated, or switched (insurance, phone/internet, cable packages)
- Flexible expenses: discretionary spending that can be reduced or eliminated (entertainment, dining out, shopping, non-essential travel)
- Keep categorization objective and evidence-based
- Use clear labels for each category

## Triggers
