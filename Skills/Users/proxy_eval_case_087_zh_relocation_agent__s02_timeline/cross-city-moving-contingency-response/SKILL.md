# cross-city-moving-contingency-response

Executes a time-bound, vendor-failure contingency protocol for cross-city moves, triggered specifically when a booked moving company cancels with ≤12 hours notice — enforcing strict reliability safeguards, legal/financial accountability, and non-overlapping family role division to maintain execution integrity under compressed timelines.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a precise, executable 12-hour fallback plan to secure an alternative moving service after last-minute cancellation by the originally booked company — without compromising safety, insurance coverage, core move date, or legal/financial accountability; enforce strict tripartite family role division (user as sole external interface, spouse as internal execution lead, parents as low-cognitive-load support) and preserve all non-negotiable reliability steps.

# Constraints & Style
- Must be fully actionable within 12 consecutive hours (start-to-finish execution window).
- Only include vendors/platforms verified as stable/reliable: official apps of national logistics providers (e.g., 'Ant Move' / 'Blue Rhino VIP'), government-regulated platforms (e.g., 'China Road Transport Network'), or pre-vetted 'Moving Emergency Alliance' channels (e.g., Ant Moving 'Lightning Substitute Plan', Lanxiniu 'Local Fleet Pool').
- Exclude all unverified, crowd-sourced, or non-contractual options (e.g., informal drivers, WeChat group referrals, cash-only handshakes).
- Require explicit confirmation steps: written quote acceptance, insurance policy number capture, GPS-tracked vehicle assignment, and enforceable penalty clauses (e.g., '20% cancellation fee + coverage of replacement cost differential').
- Mandate pre-generated, de-digitalized readiness assets: labeled packing boxes ('★ First-Ship', '🔒 Valuables'), physical 'Medication Reminder Cards', and printed 'Emergency Task Checklists' (A4, icon-based).
- Require real-time coordination via shared Tencent Docs table with auto-countdown and color-coded status (red/yellow/green); user issues mandatory bi-hourly progress broadcasts; others respond only with task-completion confirmations or ≤15-sec voice queries.
- All legal/financial steps are non-compressible: contract review, insurance verification (via China Insurance Regulatory Commission website), traceable payment (Alipay 'Secure Pay' or bank transfer), and evidence capture (time-stamped video of loading, GPS-tracked vehicle confirmation).
- Output must be structured as a minute-by-minute timeline (HH:MM format) per role, with columns: Time, Task, Deliverable, Collaboration Requirement, Failure Fallback.
- Never assume availability — every step must include a verification action (e.g., 'Call 400-XXX-XXXX and confirm real-time slot; if busy, escalate using code "MOVE-URGENT"').

# Workflow
- T+00:00–00:15: User contacts original mover’s complaint line; demands written cancellation confirmation + reason + refund timeline.
- T+00:15–01:00: User launches parallel verification on 3 pre-vetted backup platforms: (1) Ant Move App → select 'Emergency Cross-City' filter → submit load details → accept only quotes with ≥¥300,000 insurance and live driver GPS; (2) Blue Rhino VIP hotline (400-XXX-XXXX) quoting ID 'STABLE-MOVE-50K'; (3) 'China Road Transport Network' portal filing 'Urgent Dispatch Request' with cancellation proof.
- T+01:00–02:30: Spouse begins 'emergency pack' using pre-labeled boxes; parents assemble 'carry-on bag' and prepare physical reminder cards.
- T+02:30–04:00: User confirms alternative quote and initiates contract signing; spouse verifies disassembly scope (factory-designed items only); parents power down old residence.
- T+04:00–06:00: User signs contract with enforceable penalties and pays deposit via traceable channel; spouse logs loading anomalies; parents perform new-home basics (boiling water, laying slippers).
- T+06:00–08:00: User validates insurance policy number online and screenshots signed e-contract; spouse supervises full load verification; parents rest or assist only with pre-specified micro-tasks.
- T+08:00–10:00: User oversees GPS-tracked vehicle confirmation and initiates claim package; spouse completes new-home setup; parents share status in Tencent Docs.
- T+10:00–12:00: All deliverables confirmed in shared doc; unresolved items auto-trigger escalation to pre-assigned backup vendor or carrier (Deppon/Fast Express).
