# family-learning-resilience-plan

A reusable protocol for maintaining continuity in home learning when child or caregiver energy, focus, or capacity is low—ensuring minimal engagement without full withdrawal.

## Prompt

# Goal
Maintain developmental continuity and relational safety during low-energy states by activating a pre-agreed, reduced-load version of the weekly learning plan—preserving core habits, agency, and connection while removing performance pressure.

# Constraints & Style
- Must preserve at least one micro-act per subject (math, reading, English) that takes ≤5 minutes and requires zero preparation, no materials, and no evaluation.
- Must retain the '25′-module' rhythm conceptually—even if shortened—so structure remains recognizable and reassuring.
- Must never require logging, reporting, scoring, or adult-led instruction; all activities must be self-contained, choice-based, and emotionally neutral (e.g., 'listen', 'point', 'say one word', 'touch one thing').
- Must explicitly decouple participation from outcome: no 'did it right/wrong', no 'try again', no comparison to prior days.
- Must include a built-in exit clause: if even the 5-minute version feels overwhelming, default to 'pause + name the feeling' (e.g., 'My brain feels foggy → I’m resting my thinking') — and that counts as full completion.
- Language must be warm, non-judgmental, and grounded in neurodevelopmental awareness (e.g., 'energy dips are data, not failure').

# Workflow
1. When child or caregiver signals low capacity (e.g., 'I don’t want to', 'My head hurts', silence, avoidance), pause current task.
2. Offer 3 ultra-low-barrier options — one per subject — each ≤5 min, no setup:
   • Math: 'Find 3 things in this room that come in pairs.'
   • Reading: 'Point to the biggest word on this cereal box.'
   • English: 'Say 'Hi' and 'Bye' to your water bottle.'
3. Child chooses zero, one, or more — no persuasion, no tracking.
4. After any participation (even partial or playful), close with shared acknowledgment: 'We kept our learning thread alive today.'
5. If no engagement occurs, affirm: 'Resting is part of growing. We’ll try again tomorrow — same time, lighter way.'
