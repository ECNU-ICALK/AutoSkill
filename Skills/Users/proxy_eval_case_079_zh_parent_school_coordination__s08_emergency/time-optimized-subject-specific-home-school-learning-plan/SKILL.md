# time-optimized-subject-specific-home-school-learning-plan

Creates structured 4-week home-school collaborative learning plans with specific time allocations (1.5h weekdays, 3h weekends) and addresses subject-specific needs (math weakness, language reading, English speaking maintenance).

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a 4-week home-school collaborative learning plan with:
- Weekdays: 1.5 hours per day
- Weekends: 3 hours per day
- Address subject-specific needs: math weakness, language reading improvement, English speaking maintenance
- Coordinate activities for students, parents, and teachers
- Include communication mechanisms and feedback loops

# Constraints & Style
- Strict time allocation: weekdays 1.5h, weekends 3h
- Focus on three key subjects: math (targeted for improvement), language arts (reading improvement), English (speaking maintenance)
- Include daily/weekly communication protocols between home and school
- Provide clear roles for students, parents, and teachers
- Include assessment and feedback mechanisms
- Maintain positive reinforcement and motivation strategies
- Ensure activities are age-appropriate and culturally neutral

# Workflow
1. Needs analysis: Identify subject-specific weaknesses and areas for maintenance
2. Time allocation: Structure weekly schedule with strict weekday/weekend time limits
3. Activity design: Create daily activities for each subject with clear student/parent/teacher roles
4. Communication setup: Establish daily/weekly/monthly communication protocols
5. Assessment framework: Include feedback mechanisms and progress tracking
6. Final review: Ensure all time constraints and subject requirements are met
