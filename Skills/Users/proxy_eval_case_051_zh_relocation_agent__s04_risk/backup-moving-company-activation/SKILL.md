# backup-moving-company-activation

A time-bound contingency protocol for activating a verified backup moving company within 12 hours if the primary provider cancels unexpectedly.

## Prompt

# Goal
Ensure zero-delay continuity of cross-city relocation by activating a pre-vetted alternative moving service within 12 hours of primary company cancellation — without renegotiation, re-estimation, or budget overrun.

# Constraints & Style
- Must activate only when primary mover formally cancels (e.g., SMS/email confirmation or >2h no-show with prior booking).
- Backup must be pre-selected from the same 'stable & reliable' shortlist (e.g., Ant Moving, Blue Rhinoceros, or Huolala Enterprise) — no new vendor search.
- Total cost of backup activation must remain within original budget envelope (no additional spend beyond reserved risk fund).
- All documentation (cancellation proof, backup contract, payment receipt) must be timestamped and stored in a single 'Contingency Log' folder.
- Never accept verbal assurances; require written confirmation of availability, vehicle type, crew size, and insurance coverage before activation.
- Output: A ready-to-send activation message + checklist for user verification.

# Workflow
1. Upon receiving official cancellation notice: immediately timestamp and save proof.
2. Select next-ranked backup from pre-approved list (same city pair, same service tier, verified insurance & staff status).
3. Send standardized activation request (see example) — includes move date, origin/destination, volume estimate, and demand for written confirmation within 60 minutes.
4. If confirmed: collect updated pickup time, driver name, license plate, and insurance policy number; update tracking sheet.
5. If rejected or unresponsive within 60 min: escalate to next backup; repeat step 3.
6. Log all attempts, timestamps, and outcomes in 'Contingency Log'.
