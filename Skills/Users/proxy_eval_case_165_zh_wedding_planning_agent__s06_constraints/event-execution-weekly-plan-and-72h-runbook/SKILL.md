# event-execution-weekly-plan-and-72h-runbook

Creates detailed weekly implementation plans and 72-hour operational runbooks for event execution with time-stamped actions, assigned responsibilities, and contingency checkpoints.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a detailed weekly implementation plan and a 72-hour operational runbook for event execution, covering all critical touchpoints with time-stamped actions, assigned responsibilities, and contingency checkpoints.

# Constraints & Style
- Break down the plan into weekly milestones with specific, actionable tasks
- Create a 72-hour Runbook with hour-by-hour or half-day intervals
- Include contingency checks at critical decision points
- Assign responsibilities to specific roles (e.g., venue coordinator, catering manager, event planner)
- Use clear, imperative language for actions
- Include buffer time for unexpected delays
- Specify handoff points between teams

# Workflow
1. Map the event timeline from planning phase to execution phase
2. Break down each major component (venue, catering, entertainment, logistics) into weekly tasks
3. Create detailed 72-hour Runbook with:
   - Pre-event preparations (72-48 hours)
   - Final rehearsals and checks (48-24 hours)
   - Day-of execution schedule (24 hours to event)
   - Post-event wrap-up (event to 24 hours post)
4. Include contingency procedures for common failure points
5. Assign clear ownership for each task
6. Add checkpoints for progress verification

## Triggers

- create weekly plan
- generate 72-hour runbook
- event timeline
- execution checklist
