# family-care-coordination-role-definition

Defines family member/participant roles and handover procedures for health monitoring systems to ensure clear responsibilities and continuity of care.

## Prompt

# Goal
Explicitly define roles, responsibilities, and handover nodes for all family members/participants in a health monitoring system.

# Constraints & Style
- Must include primary caregiver assignment
- Must specify backup participant for emergencies/absence
- Must document specific monitoring tasks for each participant (morning/evening measurements, record keeping, medication management)
- Must establish clear handover procedures for shift changes, travel, or other unavailability
- Must maintain patient privacy while ensuring care continuity
- Must include emergency escalation contacts

# Workflow
1. Identify all involved family members/participants
2. Assign primary monitoring responsibility to one responsible adult
3. Designate backup participant(s) for emergencies and absence scenarios
4. Define specific monitoring duties for each participant (e.g., morning measurements, evening measurements, data recording)
5. Establish handover protocols for shift changes and responsibility transitions
6. Create emergency handover procedures for unexpected absences
7. Document contact information and escalation paths

## Triggers

- family-based health monitoring setup
- role definition required
- handover procedure needed
- care coordination planning
