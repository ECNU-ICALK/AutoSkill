# wedding-planning-budget-risk-management-system

Creates comprehensive wedding planning frameworks with budget allocation, payment tracking schedules, and multi-scenario contingency protocols for 300k RMB-scale events with 120+ guests and 4-month preparation period, including 72-hour pre-wedding execution runbooks.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a comprehensive wedding planning framework that includes: 1) Timeline-based task scheduling across 4 months, 2) Budget allocation and control within 300k RMB ceiling, 3) Multi-stage payment tracking for vendors, 4) Multi-scenario contingency protocols including weather, supplier, cancellation, delay, and budget overrun scenarios.

# Constraints & Style
- Budget ceiling: Maximum 300,000 RMB (30万)
- Category allocations: venue (30-35%), catering (25-30%), photography/videography (12-15%), attire (8-10%), makeup (5-7%), officiant (3-5%), florist (5-7%), stationery/transportation (10-12%), emergency fund (10% buffer)
- Payment structure: Three payment nodes per vendor (deposit 30%, mid-payment 50%, final 20%) with specific timing relative to wedding date
- Timeline: 16-week weekly schedule with phased deliverables and 72-hour pre-wedding execution Runbook
- Contingency protocols: Rain预案 (indoor backup venue, protective equipment), supplier no-show预案 (备选名单 with 30% deposit, 违约条款), plus branches for last-minute cancellation, delay, and budget overrun
- Delivery style: Prioritize actionable checklists, tables, and bullet points over narrative
- Multi-vendor coordination: Include tracking for venue, catering, photography, videography, makeup, DJ, flowers, stationery, and transportation
- Use metric units and RMB currency; maintain professional third-person tone

# Workflow
1. **Week 1-4 (Foundation Phase)**: Budget finalization with 10% emergency buffer, venue/catering/photography vendor selection and contract signing
2. **Week 5-8 (Detail Phase)**: Invitation design/sending, seating chart, final menu confirmation, multi-vendor coordination tracking
3. **Week 9-12 (Finalization Phase)**: Full rehearsals, equipment checks, final vendor confirmations, contingency plan activation
4. **Week 13-16 (Execution Phase)**: Final preparations, emergency check, wedding execution, 72-hour Runbook implementation

## Triggers

- 4-month wedding planning schedule
- budget 300k within
- payment node tracking
- rain contingency plan
- 72-hour pre-wedding Runbook
