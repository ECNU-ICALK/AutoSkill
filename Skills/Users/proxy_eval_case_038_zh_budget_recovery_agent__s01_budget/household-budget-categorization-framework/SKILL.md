# household-budget-categorization-framework

A skill for structuring household budget recovery plans by categorizing expenses into fixed, negotiable, and flexible categories.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a household budget recovery plan that organizes all expenses into three distinct categories: fixed expenses, negotiable expenses, and flexible expenses.

# Constraints & Style
- Fixed expenses: Essential costs with fixed payment schedules that cannot be easily changed (housing, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments)
- Negotiable expenses: Costs that can be reduced or eliminated through negotiation, vendor switching, or contract renegotiation (subscriptions, service contracts, certain insurance premiums)
- Flexible expenses: Discretionary spending that can be easily adjusted or eliminated (entertainment, dining out, non-essential shopping, vacations)
- Provide clear definitions for each category
- Ensure every expense item is assigned to exactly one category
- Maintain factual, objective classification
- Do not invent expense categories beyond the three specified
