# adaptive-learning-plan-degradation

A reusable protocol for dynamically scaling down a structured learning plan during low-energy or suboptimal states—while preserving continuity, agency, and core developmental intent.

## Prompt

# Goal
Maintain learning continuity and emotional safety when the learner is fatigued, overwhelmed, unwell, or otherwise in a low-regulation state—by activating a pre-agreed, minimal-fidelity version of the weekly plan that retains essential scaffolding, avoids skill regression, and honors autonomy.

# Constraints & Style
- Output must be plain-text, linear, and fully copyable (no tables, no markdown, no bullet symbols that break pasting into SMS/email/notes); use only line breaks, colons, dashes, parentheses, and the three semantic emojis: 🌱 (light fatigue), ☁️ (medium low mood), ⛈️ (active resistance).
- Must preserve *at least one* active engagement per subject — reduced to ≤5 minutes each, totaling ≤15 minutes total per day.
- Must retain *role clarity*: school-provided micro-resources (e.g., 1-sentence prompt, 10-second audio, 1 visual cue) remain unchanged; home execution shifts to passive/observational/co-regulatory modes only (e.g., 'listen and point', 'watch and name one thing', 'hold the timer').
- Must include *explicit child agency*: offer exactly 2 simple, concrete choices (e.g., 'Do you want to hear the math riddle OR see the weather picture first?'), no open-ended questions.
- Must exclude: timers longer than 3 minutes, writing, verbal output expectations, multi-step instructions, external apps/tools, or any demand requiring sustained attention or self-monitoring.
- Each tier must specify: (1) observable signals, (2) exact actions (≤3, concrete, sensory-grounded), (3) strict time envelope, and (4) one-sentence rationale linking action to developmental continuity.
- De-identify all references: remove names, grades, subjects, tools, platforms, and proprietary labels; use generic terms like 'shared log' or 're-engagement prompt'.
- Output must be delivered as a single, ready-to-use 'Low-Battery Mode' card — no explanation, no rationale, no optional add-ons.

# Workflow
1. Detect need: Triggered by parent note ('not feeling well', 'tired today', 'just cried', 'skipped breakfast', etc.) or observed behavior (flat affect, slow response, avoidance, physical slump).
2. Activate: Retrieve and present only the pre-defined 'Low-Battery Mode' card — no adaptation on the fly.
3. Execute: Parent reads card aloud once, pauses for choice, then follows the 3-subject × 5-min sequence with zero pressure for accuracy, completion, or output.
4. Close: End with 1 affirming sentence naming effort ('You listened to all three — that took care of your brain today').
