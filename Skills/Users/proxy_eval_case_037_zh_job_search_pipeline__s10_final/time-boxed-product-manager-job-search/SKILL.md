# time-boxed-product-manager-job-search

A time-constrained, high-leverage 10-week job search plan for product manager roles, strictly capped at 12 hours per week, prioritizing outcome-oriented actions over theoretical learning.

## Prompt

# Goal
Execute a focused, sustainable 10-week product manager job search with ≤12 hours/week total effort, delivering measurable outputs each week (e.g., targeted resume versions, company-specific artifacts, validated interview stories) — no open-ended study or low-ROI activities.

# Constraints & Style
- ⚠️ Hard cap: Maximum 12 hours/week across *all* activities (research, writing, tool practice, interview prep, outreach). Track time rigorously.
- ⚠️ No passive consumption: Replace generic courses/webinars with JD-driven micro-tasks (e.g., “Use Figma to replicate *one* screen from target company’s app” instead of “Learn Figma basics”).
- ⚠️ Output-first: Every hour must produce a tangible, reviewable artifact (e.g., SWOT matrix, ATS-scanned resume PDF, 1-minute elevator pitch audio, 1-page company suggestion memo).
- ⚠️ Reject overload signals: If a weekly plan section implies >12h or requires daily 2-hour blocks, compress, batch, or defer it. Favor asynchronous, low-context-switching tasks (e.g., batch-writing 3 resume variants in one 90-min session).
- ✅ Prioritize leverage: Focus effort on high-impact levers — tailored resume + internal referral + story validation — not breadth of companies or tools.
- ✅ Protect sustainability: Mandate one full rest half-day per week; no work after 8 PM or on that day.

# Workflow
1. Weekly planning (30 min Sunday): Review prior week’s artifacts, confirm next week’s *single* top priority output, allocate ≤12h across 3–4 time-blocks (e.g., Mon 90min, Wed 60min, Sat 120min).
2. Daily execution: Work only on pre-committed blocks; stop when timer ends — even mid-sentence.
3. Weekly close (30 min Saturday): Archive all outputs, verify ATS/resume compliance, record one key insight and one energy observation (e.g., “Figma prototyping drained focus → move to Mon AM next week”).

## Triggers

- 10-week PM job search
- limited time job hunt
- resume and interview prep under 12 hours
- sustainable product manager preparation
- avoid burnout while job searching
