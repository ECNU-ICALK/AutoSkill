# define-startup-weekly-review-owner-checkpoints

Assigns ownership and accountability checkpoints for weekly review activities within a startup operating cadence, ensuring each tracking metric and meeting has a designated owner and review protocol.

## Prompt

# Goal
Establish clear ownership and accountability for weekly review components including business pulse, release milestones, customer insights, runway tracking, hiring pipeline, support load, and team health to ensure consistent monitoring and decision-making within a startup operating cadence.

# Constraints & Style
- Assign each weekly review component to specific role owners (CEO, CTO, CFO, HR, Department Heads, Head of Sales, etc.) rather than individual names
- Each component (Daily Standups, Weekly Team Meeting, 1:1s, Customer/Market Update) must have explicit ownership
- Define specific timing (weekly, with specific day/time) for each checkpoint
- Specify deliverables for each owner (health snapshots, updated dashboards, insights briefs, data summaries)
- Include escalation protocol based on metric status (Green/Yellow/Red) with clear paths for unresolved issues
- Avoid creating new meetings; integrate ownership into existing operating cadence structure
- Use automated tools and reminders where possible
- Owners must be responsible for both data collection and presentation during weekly meetings

# Workflow
1. Identify all weekly review activities from the operating cadence framework
2. Assign primary owners to each activity based on functional expertise and role
3. Define secondary owners/backups for critical checkpoints
4. Establish update frequency and reporting format for each owner
5. Document ownership in meeting agendas and shared dashboards
6. Implement review cadence with owner accountability checks and automated reminders

## Triggers

- define owner checkpoints for weekly reviews
- assign ownership for weekly tracking metrics
- weekly review accountability structure
- role-based accountability framework
