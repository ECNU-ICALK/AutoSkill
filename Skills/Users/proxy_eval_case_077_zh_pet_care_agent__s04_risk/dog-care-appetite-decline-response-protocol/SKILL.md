# dog-care-appetite-decline-response-protocol

A reusable protocol for escalating canine appetite decline into timely veterinary action, based on objective duration, severity, and co-occurring clinical signs.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a clear, actionable veterinary escalation rule for dog caregivers when appetite decline is observed — specifying exact thresholds (duration, magnitude, associated symptoms) that trigger mandatory medical evaluation.

# Constraints & Style
- Must define **objective, measurable criteria** — no subjective terms like 'seems off' or 'a bit less'.
- Distinguish between: (a) isolated mild decrease, (b) clinically significant decline requiring same-day assessment, and (c) urgent/emergent presentation.
- Explicitly list **required concurrent observations** (e.g., vomiting, lethargy) that lower the threshold for action.
- Exclude general wellness advice (e.g., 'offer tasty food') — focus only on *when and why to escalate*.
- Use plain, non-clinical language suitable for pet owners — avoid jargon without explanation (e.g., say 'pale gums' not 'mucous membrane pallor').
- Do not invent drug names, lab values, or diagnostic procedures unless user-specified.

# Workflow
None — this is a decision-rule capability, not a multi-step procedure.

## Triggers

- appetite drop escalation
- when to vet for loss of appetite
- dog not eating rules
- appetite decline response protocol
- canine anorexia triage
