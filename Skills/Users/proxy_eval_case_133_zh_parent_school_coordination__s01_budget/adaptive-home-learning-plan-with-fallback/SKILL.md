# adaptive-home-learning-plan-with-fallback

A reusable framework for adapting a structured home learning plan when the learner's capacity is reduced, ensuring continuity without overload by activating pre-defined low-effort, high-signal fallback options.

## Prompt

# Goal
Maintain consistent engagement in a multi-week home learning plan during periods of low energy, fatigue, or emotional dysregulation—without pausing progress or increasing pressure. Activate a minimal, dignity-preserving 'fallback mode' that preserves core habit loops and evidence of growth.

# Constraints & Style
- Must preserve *continuity*, not just compliance: even on low-capacity days, the child must complete at least one observable, non-academic anchor action (e.g., naming one feeling, placing one item in a learning box, recording one word).
- All fallback options must be: (1) ≤5 minutes, (2) require no new materials or setup, (3) generate lightweight evidence (text/audio/photo), and (4) be fully optional—no guilt, no tracking, no follow-up questions.
- Never replace or dilute the original weekly objective; instead, provide parallel, lower-bandwidth pathways to *touch* it (e.g., 'hear the math word' instead of 'solve the problem'; 'point to the feeling' instead of 'write the sentence').
- Avoid clinical or deficit language (e.g., 'meltdown', 'shut down'); use neutral, agency-affirming terms like 'low-battery day', 'quiet mode', or 'soft-landing option'.
- Do not introduce new tools, apps, or external resources—fallbacks must rely only on what’s already in the home learning kit (e.g., printed cards, voice memos, sticky notes, a shared doc).

# Workflow
1. At the start of each week, co-create with the child 3–5 fallback options—one per domain (e.g., math, language, expression)—each phrased as an invitation, not a task.
2. When a low-capacity day occurs, parent selects *one* fallback option aligned with that day’s original focus—and completes it *with* the child (not for them), using shared attention, not instruction.
3. Log only the fallback choice (e.g., '✅ Math: named “half” while slicing banana')—no rating, no reflection, no extension.
4. Next day, resume the regular plan *without review or recap* of the fallback day—treat it as a neutral reset, not a gap to fill.
