# time-boxed-pm-job-search-review-and-plan

A reusable weekly review and forward-planning template for product manager job seekers, enforcing a strict ≤10.8-hour/week time budget, output-driven accountability, mandatory feedback-loop integration, and diagnostic rigor across three validated levers: targeting precision, value perception in outreach, and zero-cost trust evidence.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a concise, executable weekly review + next-step planning template for a product manager job seeker — strictly bounded to ≤10.8 hours total weekly effort, with clear deliverables, time estimates, built-in feedback integration, and diagnostic fidelity on the three validated drivers of inbound response: (1) targeting precision, (2) value perception in outreach, and (3) zero-cost trust evidence.

# Constraints & Style
- ✅ Enforce strict weekly time budget: all tasks across both sections must sum to ≤10.8 hours; no task exceeds 4 hours; time estimates must be precise (e.g., "1.5h", not "~2h").
- ✅ Prioritize *output-driven* actions: every task must produce a concrete, reusable artifact (e.g., 'JD keyword match table', 'portfolio prototype link', 'interview feedback summary', 'offer evaluation checklist', 'outreach message audit log').
- ✅ Require feedback closure: 'This Week Review' must include exactly three fields: ✅ Done (list completed deliverables), ⚠️ Blocked (list impediments with root cause), 📈 Insight from Feedback — where every insight drives a revision in the next week’s plan.
- ✅ Enforce diagnostic rigor: all review fields and action items must map directly to one of the three validated levers — targeting precision, value perception, or trust evidence — with no generic reflection, sentiment tracking, or unbounded tasks.
- ✅ Require verifiable root cause evidence: the '⚠️ Blocked' or '📈 Insight from Feedback' field must cite a concrete observation from actual sent messages or platform data (e.g., "22/25 first lines lacked reference to target's public activity").
- ❌ Exclude open-ended or unbounded tasks: no 'research', 'reflect', or 'network' without defined action, deliverable, and time estimate.
- ❌ Do not assume availability beyond stated capacity: no weekend marathons, no unscheduled deep work blocks.
- 📝 Use imperative, second-person language (e.g., 'Update the JD keyword match table with 3 new roles', not 'Consider updating...').
- 📝 Use neutral, professional tone; retain ✅⚠️📈 only as semantic field markers — no other emojis.
- 📝 Use de-identified placeholders: <TARGET_COMPANIES>, <JD_SAMPLE>, <PORTFOLIO_ASSET_LINK>, <INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>, <OFFER_EVALUATION_CHECKLIST>, <OUTREACH_MESSAGE_AUDIT_LOG>.

# Workflow
1. 'This Week Review' section contains exactly three labeled fields: ✅ Done (list completed deliverables), ⚠️ Blocked (list impediments with root cause and verifiable evidence), 📈 Insight from Feedback (state one actionable revision triggered by application/interview/resume/outreach feedback, tied to one of the three diagnostic levers).
2. 'Next Week Action Plan' section contains up to three prioritized tasks — one required per diagnostic lever, but only the weakest lever (selected by user) is mandatory; others are optional if their combined time stays within the 10.8h cap and adds measurable leverage — each with: (a) an imperative action verb, (b) estimated time in 0.5h increments, and (c) explicit deliverable.
