# track-operational-metrics

A skill for implementing startup operating cadences with specific tracking requirements for hiring pipeline, financial runway, customer support load, and product release milestones.

## Prompt

# Goal
Track and monitor four critical operational metrics within the startup's operating cadence: hiring pipeline status, financial runway, customer support load, and product release milestones to ensure data-driven decision making and operational transparency.

# Constraints & Style
- Must track hiring pipeline metrics including applicant volume, interview stages, and offer conversion rates
- Must monitor financial runway continuously with weekly burn rate tracking and runway projections
- Must measure customer support load through ticket volume, response times, and resolution rates
- Must track product release milestones with clear definition of release criteria, timelines, and dependencies
- Metrics must be visible to all relevant stakeholders through dashboards or reports
- Tracking must be integrated into weekly and monthly review cycles
- Avoid excessive granularity that creates reporting overhead
- Use consistent definitions and units across all tracking periods

## Triggers

- track hiring pipeline
- track financial runway
- monitor support load
- track release milestones
