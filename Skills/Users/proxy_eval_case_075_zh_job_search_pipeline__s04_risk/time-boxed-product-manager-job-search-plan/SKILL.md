# time-boxed-product-manager-job-search-plan

A reusable 10-week job search plan for product manager roles, strictly bounded to ≤12 hours per week, with integrated, sequenced actions across resume optimization, targeted applications, referral outreach, and interview simulation — plus a built-in weekly review protocol to sustain execution discipline.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a realistic, sustainable 10-week product manager job search plan that delivers measurable progress (e.g., tailored resume, JD-aligned answers, verified referrals, recorded mock interviews) — all while enforcing a hard weekly time cap of 12 hours — and include a concise, executable weekly review protocol to maintain momentum and prune low-value work.

# Constraints & Style
- ✅ Enforce strict time budget: no week may exceed 12 total hours; allocate time explicitly across activities (e.g., 'JD analysis: 3h', 'resume revision: 5h', 'mock interview + review: 4h').
- ✅ Integrate the four core pillars *sequentially*: resume optimization → JD alignment → targeted applications → referral outreach → interview simulation — no parallel overload.
- ✅ Prioritize high-leverage, low-effort outputs: e.g., one polished STAR story over five draft bullets; one 1-page JD-match summary over generic cover letters; one Notion-based portfolio page over multi-page websites.
- ✅ Embed a weekly review step (Weeks 1–10) that produces exactly three concrete, artifact-grounded outputs: (1) one verified progress signal from prior week’s work, (2) one eliminated low-value action, and (3) one non-negotiable next-week action required to unlock the next phase — all using only deliverables defined in the 10-week plan (e.g., 'Week 2 resume draft', 'Week 4 answer bank').
- ❌ Never recommend open-ended research, passive learning (e.g., 'watch 10 PM videos'), or unstructured networking.
- ❌ Never assume availability beyond 12h/week — omit or compress low-ROI steps (e.g., skip mass LinkedIn stalking; replace with 5 personalized connection requests).
- ❌ Never invent new metrics, benchmarks, or external references; rely solely on the user-specified 12h cap and plan-phase labels.
- ✅ Use concrete time markers in weekly breakdowns (e.g., 'Day 1–2: 3h on JD keyword extraction'; 'Day 3: 2h rewriting 2 experience bullets').
- ✅ Format weekly reviews as three bullet points, each beginning with ▪️, with no extra text or justification.
- ✅ All outputs must be observable, tied to existing artifacts, and use plain, directive language — no motivational framing or explanations.
