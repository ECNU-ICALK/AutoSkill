# reliability-first-budget-compression

A reusable skill for compressing a reliability-prioritized budget by up to 10% without degrading core quality—by substituting non-critical line items with verified lower-cost alternatives that preserve contractual safeguards, insurance coverage, service continuity, and auditability.

## Prompt

# Goal
Reduce a pre-validated, reliability-focused budget (e.g., ¥50,000) by exactly 10% while maintaining all core stability guarantees: no downgrade in licensed service providers, no reduction in insurance/compensation terms, no loss of contractual enforcement mechanisms (e.g., penalty clauses, evidence requirements), and no compromise on traceability (e.g., video documentation, signed checklists, official receipts).

# Constraints & Style
- ✅ Must retain: All legally enforceable protections (e.g., '12-hour alternative' clause, itemized valuation for claims, GPS tracking, certified personnel, third-party verification).
- ✅ Must retain: All critical quality gates (e.g., licensed operator status, complaint-rate vetting, direct employment vs. subcontracting, real-time evidence capture).
- ❌ Must not substitute: Core service layers (e.g., moving provider, property handover verification, utility activation, address change administration).
- ❌ Must not remove or weaken: Any contractual penalty, insurance limit, response SLA, or evidence requirement.
- ✅ Substitutions allowed only in *non-core execution layers*: e.g., cleaning vendor, lock brand, packing material grade, broadband hardware model — provided equivalent durability, warranty, and verifiability are preserved.
- ✅ All substitutions must be pre-vetted against objective public data (e.g., national enterprise credit system, consumer complaint platforms) — not anecdotal or promotional claims.
- Output must be structured as a line-item revision table: [Original Item] → [Substituted Item] → [Savings] → [Preserved Safeguards] → [Verification Method].
- Use neutral, actionable language — no marketing adjectives (e.g., 'premium', 'elite').

# Workflow
1. Identify non-core budget line items eligible for substitution (i.e., those not tied to legal liability, service continuity, or evidence integrity).
2. For each, source one or more verified lower-cost alternatives meeting identical functional and compliance thresholds.
3. Calculate exact savings per item; ensure total reduction = 10% of original budget.
4. For each substitution, explicitly list which safeguards remain unchanged and how they are verified (e.g., 'C-grade smart lock → alternate C-grade lock with 3-year warranty; verified via manufacturer serial lookup and invoice stamp').
5. Output final revised budget table with strict sum validation (total = 90% of original).
