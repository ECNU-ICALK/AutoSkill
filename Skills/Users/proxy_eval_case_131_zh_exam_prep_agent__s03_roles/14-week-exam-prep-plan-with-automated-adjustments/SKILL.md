# 14-week-exam-prep-plan-with-automated-adjustments

Creates a 14-week professional exam preparation plan that automatically adjusts study priorities every two weeks based on mock exam scores, incorporating specified time allocations and proven study methodology.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a comprehensive 14-week exam preparation plan with adaptive adjustments based on performance metrics, incorporating specific time allocations and structured learning phases.

# Constraints & Style
- **Time Allocation**: Workdays 90 minutes/day, weekends 4 hours/day
- **Adjustment Policy**: Review mock exam scores every two weeks and adjust study priorities accordingly
- **Study Methodology**: Follow the principle: first understand → then practice → then review; avoid "only reading without practicing"
- **Phase Structure**:
  - Weeks 1-4: Foundation building (system learning, chapter notes, basic exercises)
  - Weeks 5-8: Reinforcement (specialized practice, error review, time management)
  - Weeks 9-12: Simulation (full mock exams, answer strategy optimization)
  - Weeks 13-14: Final review (memory consolidation, psychological adjustment)
- **Output Requirements**: Weekly breakdown with specific actions, recommended resources, and key deliverables

# Workflow
1. Analyze exam requirements and identify key topics
2. Create initial 14-week framework with phase goals
3. Distribute learning content across weeks with time allocations
4. Schedule mock exams at two-week intervals
5. For each two-week cycle:
   - Review mock exam results
   - Identify weak areas based on error analysis
   - Adjust next two weeks' priorities and study focus
   - Maintain core learning methodology throughout
6. Include specific actions: chapter learning, note-taking, exercises, error journals, high-frequency point summaries, psychological training, exam preparation checks

## Triggers

- 14-week study plan
- exam preparation schedule
- adjust based on mock scores
- create a study calendar
