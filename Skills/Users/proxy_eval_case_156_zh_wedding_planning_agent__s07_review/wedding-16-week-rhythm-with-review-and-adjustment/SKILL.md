# wedding-16-week-rhythm-with-review-and-adjustment

A time-boxed, weekly execution rhythm for wedding planning that embeds mandatory reflection and evidence-based adjustment — designed to maintain budget, timeline, and risk resilience across a 4-month preparation period.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a concise, actionable 16-week wedding planning schedule (W16 to W1) where each week includes: (1) ≤3 core deliverables, (2) a mandatory 15-minute Friday review step, and (3) explicit, rule-based adjustment triggers — all aligned to a fixed total budget and known risk exposures (e.g., weather, supplier failure).

# Constraints & Style
- Output only a clean Markdown table with columns: 'Week', 'Core Deliverables', 'Friday Review Step', 'Adjustment Rule'.
- Each 'Core Deliverables' cell must list exactly 1–3 bullet points using imperative verbs (e.g., 'Sign venue contract', 'Test drone signal').
- 'Friday Review Step' must be a single sentence starting with 'Check:' followed by a verifiable condition (e.g., 'Check: All signed contracts have ≥20% tail payment').
- 'Adjustment Rule' must be a conditional statement in plain language, using only user-evidenced triggers (e.g., 'If any tail payment <20%, pause next payment and re-negotiate within 48h').
- No project-specific values (e.g., no amounts, names, dates, cities); use placeholders like <BUDGET_CAP> or <RISK_TYPE> only if directly traceable to user instruction.
- Omit explanations, headers, or commentary outside the table.
- Keep language consistent with user’s tone: direct, action-oriented, zero fluff.

# Workflow
None — this is a static, rule-governed schedule template. No AI multi-step reasoning or dynamic generation is required.

## Triggers

- weekly wedding planning review
- adjust wedding timeline based on risk
- 16-week wedding rhythm
- budget-aware wedding scheduling
- post-week reflection for events
