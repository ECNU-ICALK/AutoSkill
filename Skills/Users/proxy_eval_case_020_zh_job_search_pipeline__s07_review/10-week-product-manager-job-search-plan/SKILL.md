# 10-week-product-manager-job-search-plan

A time-boxed, iterative 10-week plan for product manager job seekers that balances depth and sustainability by capping weekly effort at 12 hours, with built-in feedback loops for resume refinement, targeted applications, strategic referrals, and progressive interview simulation — including mandatory weekly 10-minute review and adaptive planning triggered by real-world signals like reply rate.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a sustainable, executable 10-week job search plan for a product manager candidate — strictly bounded to ≤12 hours/week — covering resume optimization, targeted application, referral outreach, and interview simulation, all aligned to real job descriptions and grounded in verifiable progress data.

# Constraints & Style
- ⚠️ Enforce hard weekly time cap: total effort must not exceed 12 hours (e.g., 1.5–2 hrs/day Mon–Fri + 2–3 hrs weekend); explicitly call out time allocations per task.
- ✅ Prioritize *iterative alignment*: every deliverable (resume, cover note, answers) must be revised weekly based on real-world signals (e.g., JD updates, rejection feedback, interview questions, reply rate).
- ✅ Structure as a week-by-week table with columns: Week | Theme | Key Tasks (time-estimated) | Deliverables | Critical Guardrails.
- ✅ Embed built-in checkpoints: weekly 10-minute self-review using the 4-field template (✅ delivered / ⚠️ time thief / ➡️ one focus action / ⏳ fixed time anchors), explicit handoff points between phases (e.g., ‘Resume v1 → used in Week 2 applications → refined in Week 4 using interview feedback’), and automatic corrective action if reply rate falls below 8% after ≥25 outreach attempts.
- ✅ For reply rate <8%, the action plan must include: (i) ATS repair instructions with JD keyword insertion, (ii) immediate follow-up actions (e.g., 'Send 3 referrals via company career page'), and (iii) reference to the 8% diagnostic checklist — using only confirmed tools: ATS detector (e.g., Resume Worded), referral message generator, and channel priority (company career pages > LinkedIn > BOSS).
- ❌ Do not include generic advice (e.g., ‘be confident’, ‘research companies’); only include actions with concrete time estimates, outputs, and decision rules.
- ❌ Do not assume full-time availability; avoid weekend-heavy or burnout-prone pacing (e.g., no 6-hour Saturday sprints).
- ❌ Do not separate ‘resume’, ‘interview’, ‘referral’ as silos — show how each feeds the next (e.g., ‘Week 3 portfolio snippet → inserted into Week 4 resume bullet’).
- ❌ Never invent tasks, metrics, or tools not previously used or approved; only reference assets already introduced (e.g., ‘JD拆解速查表’, ‘内推话术生成器’, ‘ATS检测链接’). Use plain English unless user explicitly requests Chinese output.
- ❌ De-identify all specifics: replace company names with <COMPANY>, JD terms with <JD_TERM>, and tools with generic labels (e.g., 'ATS detector', 'referral message generator').
