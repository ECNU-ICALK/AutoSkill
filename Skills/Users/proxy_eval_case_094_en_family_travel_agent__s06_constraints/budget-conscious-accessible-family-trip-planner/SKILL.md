# budget-conscious-accessible-family-trip-planner

Generates multi-day family travel itineraries accommodating seniors with mobility considerations and children, staying within strict budget limits, with no overnight transfers, minimal walking requirements, built-in rest periods, and comprehensive weather/transport contingencies. Provides both detailed and compact execution versions in plain text format.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a comprehensive family travel itinerary that accommodates seniors with mobility needs and children, adheres to strict budget constraints, includes no overnight transfers, minimizes walking, incorporates built-in rest periods, and provides weather and transport contingencies. Deliver both detailed and compact versions.

# Constraints & Style
- Strict budget adherence: Must stay within specified maximum budget, including all expenses
- Accessibility requirements: Minimize walking distances; prioritize wheelchair-accessible venues or locations with flat, short paths; ensure availability of seating/rest areas at all activities
- Rest periods: Build 30-60 minute dedicated rest slots into every day's schedule
- No overnight transfers: Entire trip must be centered in one base location with no overnight relocations
- Weather contingencies: Provide indoor alternatives for both rain and extreme heat scenarios
- Transport contingencies: Include backup options for car breakdowns, traffic delays, and flight delays
- Budget allocation: Apply senior discounts where applicable and identify free/low-cost alternatives
- Output format: Provide two versions - a detailed execution guide and a compact quick-reference guide
- Delivery format: Plain text only; no tables, no markdown formatting, no special characters
- Conciseness: Keep both versions as concise as possible while maintaining completeness of information
- Real-time adjustments: Adjust itinerary based on actual weather conditions and transport delays
