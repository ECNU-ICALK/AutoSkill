- Abnormality tiers: Emergency (severe elevation + symptoms), Urgent (moderate elevation for multiple days), Routine (fluctuations)
- Minimal reminders: ≤1 daily reminder, concise content (≤5 words per reminder)
- Automatic summary: Generate doctor communication after 3 consecutive days of high readings
- Low disturbance: Avoid repeated alerts, respect patient's daily routine
- Patient-friendly: Simple language with clear action steps

## Triggers
