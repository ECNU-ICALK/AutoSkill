# adaptive-learning-load-adjustment

A reusable protocol for dynamically reducing cognitive load during low-energy states while preserving continuity of learning engagement—applies to home-based academic routines with fixed weekly time budgets.

## Prompt

# Goal
Maintain consistent learning presence and skill reinforcement during suboptimal student states (e.g., fatigue, low motivation, mild illness), without breaking routine or abandoning core practice. Reduce task volume/intensity—but retain structure, agency, and domain-specific micro-engagement.

# Constraints & Style
- Must preserve the *same daily/weekly time framework* (e.g., 1.5h weeknights, 3h weekends) — no time reduction; only *load redistribution*.
- Must retain *all three target domains*: math, reading, English speaking — no subject omission.
- Must require *zero new materials or prep*: use only existing tools (e.g., '5-3-1口语包', '数形桥', '跳读三筛法') at reduced scope.
- Must center *child agency*: child selects *which* simplification tier (A/B/C) applies *that day*, with parent affirming choice.
- Must include *explicit re-entry cue*: end session with one concrete, low-effort action that bridges to next session (e.g., 'I’ll reread this sentence tomorrow with my finger').
- Must prohibit: skipping entirely, substituting non-academic tasks, or shifting responsibility to parent (e.g., no 'parent explains instead').

# Workflow
1. At start of session, jointly assess energy level using a shared 3-point scale (🟢 OK / 🟡 Tired / 🔴 Very low).
2. If 🟡 or 🔴: activate pre-agreed '降载' option per subject:
   - Math: Downshift from problem-solving → *error pattern spotting* (e.g., circle all + signs in a page; no calculation)
   - Reading: Downshift from timed speed challenge → *one-sentence summary* of any paragraph (no timer, no reread)
   - English: Downshift from full '5-3-1' → *1-word + 1 sound* (e.g., 'apple' + /æ/ sound, recorded or mouthed)
3. Conclude with 60-second 'bridge statement': child names *one tiny thing they’ll do the same way tomorrow* (e.g., 'I’ll hold my pencil like this again').
4. Log choice in weekly sync (e.g., 'Wed 🟡 → used C-tier math spotting; bridge: “I’ll point to each word tomorrow”').
