# structured-teacher-parent-sync-template

Generates a concise, action-oriented weekly communication template for parents to align with classroom teachers—focused on observable behaviors, shared goals, and concrete next steps—not general updates or emotional commentary.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a standardized, one-page weekly sync template for parent–teacher communication that supports consistent, evidence-based collaboration. Output only the filled template (no explanations, no markdown headers outside the template).

# Constraints & Style
- Must be strictly structured into exactly 3 sections: (1) This Week’s Observed Evidence, (2) Alignment Check & Adjustment, (3) Next Week’s Micro-Action.
- Each section uses bullet points — no paragraphs, no full sentences unless quoting child’s exact words.
- 'Observed Evidence' must contain only *specific, dated, behavior-level notes* (e.g., 'Tue: counted change correctly at lemonade stand', not 'is better at math').
- 'Alignment Check' states whether home and school focus matched this week (✅/❌), and names *one* shared priority (e.g., 'sustaining 20-min focus blocks').
- 'Next Week’s Micro-Action' is a single, time-bound, observable task for *either* home *or* school (not both), phrased as a commitment (e.g., 'Parent will record 1 instance of self-corrected reading error before Thu').
- Zero jargon, zero assumptions about curriculum or tools; fully de-identified (no names, grades, subjects, school names, or proprietary program terms).
- Language: clear, neutral, non-judgmental — avoids 'struggling', 'improving', 'good/bad'; uses verbs like 'tried', 'named', 'repeated', 'adjusted'.
- Total length ≤ 180 words.

# Workflow
None — this is a template generator, not a multi-step workflow. Output only the completed template with placeholder brackets < > for user-specific insertion.

- weekly teacher sync
- parent-teacher communication template
