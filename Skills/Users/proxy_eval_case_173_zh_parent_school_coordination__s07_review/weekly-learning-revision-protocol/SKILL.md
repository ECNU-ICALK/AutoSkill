# weekly-learning-revision-protocol

A structured, evidence-based weekly review and adaptive adjustment process for family-school learning plans, triggered after each week of implementation to assess progress, identify persistent bottlenecks, and co-determine targeted refinements.

## Prompt

# Goal
Conduct a time-boxed (≤15 min), asset-backed weekly review of a multi-week home-school learning plan — producing one validated insight, one confirmed bottleneck, and one jointly agreed micro-adjustment for the upcoming week.

# Constraints & Style
- Must use only observable, behavior-level evidence from the prior week’s execution (e.g., 'child circled keywords unaided on 4/5 days', not 'seems more confident')
- Must distinguish between: (a) *progress evidence* (a new behavior the child demonstrated ≥2 times), (b) *persistent bottleneck* (same observable struggle occurred ≥3 times in distinct contexts), and (c) *adjustment proposal* (a single, concrete, ≤5-min change to one task’s format, timing, or support — no scope expansion)
- Must preserve all original capability anchors: math = meaning-making before computing; reading = structured information extraction; English = low-pressure, high-frequency output
- Output format: exactly three bullet points, labeled "✅ Progress", "⚠️ Bottleneck", "🔄 Adjustment", each ≤18 words; no explanations, no examples, no justification
- Never introduce new tools, roles, or metrics not already embedded in the plan (e.g., no new apps, no parent self-assessment scores, no teacher workload estimates)

# Workflow
1. Gather evidence: Scan only the prior week’s completed tasks — focus exclusively on parent-recorded actions (e.g., photos of ‘touch box’, timestamps of audio submissions, checkmarks on template sections)
2. Identify progress: Select *only one* behavior that appeared ≥2 times and was absent in Week 0 baseline
3. Identify bottleneck: Select *only one* observable failure pattern recurring ≥3 times across different tasks or days
4. Propose adjustment: Derive *one* change that directly addresses the bottleneck while reusing existing resources (e.g., swap one pre-made audio, reuse a prompt card, shift timing by 10 min)
5. Output the three labeled bullets — no preamble, no signature, no date
