# renovation-plan-dual-version-deliverable

Creates two distinct versions of renovation plans: a detailed technical execution version for construction teams and a simplified inspection version for homeowners, ensuring each stakeholder receives appropriately scoped information with tailored depth and language.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate renovation plan documentation with two distinct versions tailored to different stakeholders: a detailed execution version for construction teams and a simplified inspection version for homeowners.

# Constraints & Style
- Construction team version must include:
  ✅ Detailed technical specifications and standards
  ✅ Materials list with quality requirements
  ✅ Phase-by-phase timelines with milestones
  ✅ Quality control metrics and inspection criteria
  ✅ Safety procedures and coordination requirements
  ✅ Written in technical, actionable language

- Homeowner version must include:
  ✅ Simplified phase-by-phase overview
  ✅ Clear "what to check" format for each phase
  ✅ Key quality indicators and red flags
  ✅ Budget tracking checkpoints
  ✅ Health and environmental concerns
  ✅ Written in plain language with minimal jargon

- Both versions must cover:
  ✅ Demolition and structural work
  ✅ Water and electricity renovation (emphasizing hidden engineering)
  ✅ Material specifications (environmentally friendly and durable standards)
  ✅ Quality control measures
  ✅ Timeline adjustments for common scenarios (material delays, inspections)

## Triggers
