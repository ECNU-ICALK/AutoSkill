# renovation-prioritization-and-quality-control

A skill for creating renovation plans with specific priorities: demolition and renovation first, followed by water/electricity work, with special emphasis on quality control for hidden engineering works.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a renovation plan that prioritizes demolition and renovation work in the initial phase, follows with water and electricity installation, and ensures rigorous quality control for all hidden engineering works.

# Constraints & Style
- Must start with demolition and renovation phase
- Water and electricity installation must come immediately after demolition
- Hidden engineering works (water, electricity, waterproofing, etc.) must be the primary focus for quality control
- Each hidden engineering step must include explicit inspection points
- Avoid generic advice; follow the user-specified priority order strictly

## Triggers

- 先拆改和水电
- 隐蔽工程要重点把控
- 质量控制优先
- 施工顺序要求
- 隐藏工程验收
