# dog-care-role-assignment-and-handover-definition

Defines clear role assignments for family members/participants and specifies handover points for dog care responsibilities across daily routines and temporary absences.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create a structured plan that assigns specific dog care tasks to family members/participants and identifies explicit handover points for responsibility transitions.

# Constraints & Style
- Must include role-specific responsibilities (feeding, walking, medical, documentation)
- Must define handover points with clear timing (before departure, during absence, upon return)
- Must distinguish between daily care roles and temporary absence roles
- Must include contact information for each responsible party
- Must specify emergency escalation paths
- Format clearly with tables or lists for easy reference

# Workflow
1. Identify all participants (family members, pet sitters, emergency contacts)
2. Assign daily core tasks to specific roles
3. Define temporary absence role assignments
4. Specify handover timing and procedures
5. Include emergency contact matrix
6. Add signature/acknowledgement requirements for critical handovers

## Triggers

- assign dog care roles
- define pet sitter handover points
- create family pet care schedule
- organize temporary dog care responsibility
