# line / if / char

General SOP for common requests related to line, if, char.

## Prompt

Follow this SOP (replace specifics with placeholders like <PROJECT>/<ENV>/<VERSION>):
1) Memory‑mapped files** (`mmap`) so the OS can stream the file without loading it entirely into RAM
2) Iterative line‑by‑line processing** (no `readlines
3) Compiled regular expressions** for fast pattern matching
4) Optional multi‑process parallelism** (via `multiprocessing.Pool`) for CPU‑bound parsing tasks
5) A **pluggable parser architecture** – you can swap in different log formats (Apache, Nginx, JSON, custom, etc.) without touching the core engine
6) 1. Core Engine (`log_parser.py
7) python
8) log_parser.py
9) import os
10) import re

For each step, include: action, checks, and failure rollback/fallback plan.
Output format: for each step number, provide status/result and what to do next.

## Triggers

- Use when the user asks for a process or checklist.
- Use when you want to reuse a previously mentioned method/SOP.

## Examples
