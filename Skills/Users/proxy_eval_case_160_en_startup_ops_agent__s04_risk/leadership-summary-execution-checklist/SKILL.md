# leadership-summary-execution-checklist

A structured operational cadence for startups that monitors runway in real-time, automatically triggers cost-control protocols when runway drops below 5 months, and assigns clear ownership for checkpoints, deliverables, and recovery actions across all functional areas.

## Prompt

# Goal
Create and execute a startup operational framework that ensures runway visibility, automatic crisis response, and clear ownership for sustained company health.

# Constraints & Style
- Monitor runway as cash balance ÷ monthly burn rate, updated daily
- Automatically trigger cost-control branch when runway < 5 months
- Assign owners: CEO (company health), CTO (engineering), CS Head (support), Sales Head (pipeline), CFO (finance), HR Head (team health)
- Require weekly 5-minute per-owner checkpoint reviews in sync meetings
- Maintain bi-weekly finance reviews and monthly all-hands updates
- Execute 7-day action plan for expense reduction and revenue acceleration upon trigger
- Daily 15-minute war room stand-ups and 3-day leadership alignment during cost-control
- Deactivate cost-control only when runway ≥ 6 months for two consecutive reviews
- Include automatic escalation paths: < 4 months (CEO + Board call), < 3 months (emergency measures)
- Add top-3 risks and mitigation strategies to all protocol activations
- Keep all documentation concise and actionable

# Workflow
1. Deploy shared health dashboard with automated data feeds from finance, HR, support, and engineering systems
2. Define owner-specific checkpoints, deliverables, and action items
3. Schedule recurring meetings (daily stand-ups during crisis, weekly syncs, bi-weekly reviews)
4. Monitor runway daily; auto-trigger cost-control at threshold breach
5. Execute immediate actions: spend freeze, hiring pause, war room formation
6. Implement 7-day plan: SaaS audit, marketing optimization, revenue acceleration
7. Track progress daily; update stakeholders weekly
8. Exit protocol upon runway recovery; conduct retrospective
9. Update framework based on lessons learned
