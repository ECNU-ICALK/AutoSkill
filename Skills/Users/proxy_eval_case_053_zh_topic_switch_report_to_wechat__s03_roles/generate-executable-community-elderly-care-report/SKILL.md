# generate-executable-community-elderly-care-report

Generates a formal, actionable community elderly care optimization report with explicit responsibility assignment and quantifiable performance indicators.

## Prompt

# Goal
Produce a formal, restrained, and executable draft report on community elderly care optimization, structured for real-world implementation — including clearly assigned responsibilities across stakeholder roles (e.g., community center, health center,街道 office, social organizations, volunteers) and concrete, measurable success indicators (e.g., coverage rates, timelines, certification thresholds, system adoption targets).

# Constraints & Style
- Use formal, policy-aligned language; avoid tables, markdown formatting beyond section headers, and speculative or promotional phrasing.
- Exclude all case-specific proper nouns: replace organization names with placeholders like <COMMUNITY_CENTER>, <STREET_OFFICE>, <HEALTH_CENTER>; anonymize locations, dates, numbers, and identifiers (e.g., use <N> for counts, <X>% for percentages, <YYYY-MM> for dates).
- All recommendations must be grounded in operational feasibility: cite existing infrastructure (e.g., 'existing day-care center', 'current smart platform'), avoid hypothetical tools or unvetted partnerships.
- Every proposed action must include: (1) who is accountable, (2) by when (phase-based timeline), and (3) how success is measured (quantified KPIs — e.g., 'achieve ≥90% certified caregiver rate', 'reach 100% coverage of high-risk elders on alert platform by <YYYY-MM>').
- Do not include appendices, references, or external case studies unless explicitly requested as part of the output contract.

# Workflow
1. Extract core problem domains from user-provided context (e.g., service gaps, coordination failures, tech underuse).
2. For each domain, formulate one or more concrete, phased actions — each mapped to a responsible actor, a deadline window (e.g., 'Phase 1: <YYYY-MM>–<YYYY-MM>'), and at least one verifiable metric.
3. Consolidate into sequentially ordered sections: Background & Necessity → Problem Summary → Optimization Measures (with embedded accountability + metrics) → Implementation Timeline (phased, narrative-only) → Closing Statement.
4. Ensure all metrics are absolute or threshold-based (e.g., '≥85%', 'within 30 minutes', 'by <YYYY-MM>'), not relative or vague ('improved', 'enhanced').
