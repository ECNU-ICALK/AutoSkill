# convert-policy-report-to-public-facing-article

Transforms formal, accountability-focused policy reports into clear, accessible, fact-accurate public communications for general community audiences — preserving all original commitments, timelines, responsibilities, and metrics without invention or dilution.

## Prompt

# Goal
Convert a formal, responsibility-anchored policy report (e.g., community service optimization plan) into a public-facing article for ordinary residents — written in plain, warm, conversational language that prioritizes clarity and trustworthiness, while strictly preserving all factual content: who is responsible, what will happen, where/when it starts, and what is verifiably promised.

# Constraints & Style
- Language must be easy to understand: short sentences; active voice; relatable framing (e.g., 'you can…', 'your parents may…'); avoid jargon, acronyms, or bureaucratic terms ('stakeholder engagement', 'synergy', 'leverage').
- Zero fabrication: no new services, deadlines, eligibility rules, funding amounts, or technical capabilities may be added, implied, or exaggerated. All claims must map directly and unambiguously to statements in the source report.
- Preserve all concrete facts: exact start dates (e.g., '9月底', '10月起'), quantified metrics (e.g., '70% subsidy', '5-minute response'), named locations (e.g., 'XX花园东门物业楼'), responsible units (e.g., '社区卫生服务中心'), and delivery channels (e.g., '居委会窗口', '热线XXX-XXXXXXX').
- Do not omit or soften accountability elements: if the source names a lead unit ('街道公共服务办公室') or ties funding to milestones ('二期120万元于2024年10月底前依据三项指标完成情况拨付'), retain that linkage — but rephrase accessibly (e.g., 'funding depends on whether these three things are done on time').
- Tone must be respectful, grounded, and reassuring — not promotional, not urgent, not sentimental. Avoid superlatives ('revolutionary', 'unprecedented'), metaphors ('beacon of hope'), or emotional manipulation.
- Structure for scanability: use clear section headers, bullet points, and a concise summary table ('3-minute guide') with only verified, de-identified role-based entries (e.g., 'If you’re an 80+ solo resident → register for home visits').
- Never include disclaimers like 'subject to change' or 'pending approval' unless explicitly stated in the source.

# Workflow
1. Extract all binding commitments from the source report: actions, actors, deadlines, locations, numbers, and conditions.
2. Map each commitment to a reader-relevant frame (e.g., 'Silver-Age Service Station opens 9/30' → 'A new help spot opens downstairs this September').
3. Rewrite using only those extracted facts — no inference, no extrapolation, no 'what this means for you' beyond literal translation.
4. Compile a final '3-minute guide' table listing only roles (e.g., '65–74-year-old healthy adult') and corresponding verified actions/dates — with zero hypotheticals or conditional phrasing.
