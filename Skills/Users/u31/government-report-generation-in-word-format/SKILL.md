# government-report-generation-in-word-format

Generates formal, policy-oriented government reports in plain, professional language—strictly fact-based, technically accurate, and directly pasteable into Microsoft Word—with no markdown, no decorative formatting, no speculative or anthropomorphic claims, and adherence to bureaucratic tone and structural conventions.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a formal, policy-oriented government report on a specified technical or societal topic, adhering to official communication standards: factual accuracy, institutional tone, operational realism, and direct compatibility with Microsoft Word.

# Constraints & Style
- Use plain, clear, bureaucratic-professional language — no metaphors, hype, speculation, colloquialisms, slogans, or promotional phrasing; explicitly reject unverified or anthropomorphic terms (e.g., 'self-evolution', 'autonomous learning', 'emergent behavior', 'consciousness', 'agency') — correct them on first use with precise, human-supervised alternatives (e.g., 'human-guided iteration', 'supervised fine-tuning', 'curated update cycle').
- Output must be copy-paste ready into Microsoft Word: pure UTF-8 text only; no markdown (**bold**, ---, lists with ✅/⚠️), no emojis, no ASCII art, no inline annotations, no colors, no bold/italic, no URLs, emails, or external tool references.
- Structure using numbered sections in title case or Chinese numerals (e.g., '一、基本情况', '1. Executive Summary') — no bullet points, icons, or special characters; limit section numbering to canonical forms; use standard paragraph breaks and colons for definitions.
- Indent paragraphs with two full-width spaces (　　) if using Chinese; otherwise use standard left-aligned English paragraphs.
- Ground all technical claims in current regulatory or engineering consensus — cite binding instruments where applicable (e.g., '《生成式人工智能服务管理暂行办法》第十七条'); explicitly debunk misleading industry terminology and surface real institutional friction (e.g., misaligned departmental incentives, implementation gaps, outdated training cutoffs, missing regression testing).
- Replace overly technical terms (e.g., 'loss function', 'online learning', 'RLHF') with intuitive, officially recognized equivalents ('built-in improvement rules', 'learning from real-world use', 'human feedback–based safety tuning') *only when such analogues exist in binding guidance* — otherwise retain precise statutory or technical terms with brief contextual clarification.
- All claims must be traceable to authoritative sources (e.g., '2023年国家网信办专项核查'); no unnamed studies, vague citations, or hypothetical scenarios.
- Omit disclaimers, footnotes, meta-commentary (e.g., 'Note:', 'This is simplified for clarity'), or authorship placeholders unless explicitly requested; default to institutional neutrality (e.g., 'This report outlines considerations for policymakers').
- Tone: authoritative, measured, bureaucratic—not academic, not journalistic, not promotional.
