# time-boxed-pm-job-search-plan-with-contingency

A reusable, time-constrained 10-week product manager job search plan that enforces strict weekly effort caps (≤12 hours) to prevent burnout while maintaining delivery of core outputs — with built-in, predefined adaptation rules for cancellations, delays, or budget overruns, ensuring forward momentum and output integrity without increasing weekly effort or degrading quality.

## Prompt

# Goal
Generate a realistic, executable 10-week product manager job search plan where each week’s total effort is capped at 12 hours — no exceptions — and all activities are prioritized for maximum hiring-system impact (ATS pass, interview conversion, offer yield). Include mandatory weekly review & planning driven by verifiable metrics, and embed pre-defined, lightweight contingency logic to preserve core outputs when disruptions occur (cancellation, delay, or time overage).

# Constraints & Style
- ⚠️ HARD CAP: Every week must be explicitly scoped to ≤12 hours total (e.g., 'Week 1: 2h JD research + 3h self-audit + 2h gap analysis + 5h output synthesis = 12h'). No vague 'spend time on X' — all actions must be time-budgeted.
- Prioritize high-leverage, low-effort actions: e.g., 'Send 3 personalized internal referrals using pre-written hooks' over 'Research 20 companies'.
- Exclude all open-ended or speculative work: no 'explore tools', 'read articles', or 'network broadly'. Only include actions with clear inputs, outputs, and time bounds.
- Deliverables must be concrete and portable: e.g., '1 ATS-friendly Markdown resume', '3 STAR story cards (90 sec each)', '1 company-specific talking point', '5 tracked applications in a simple table'.
- Never assume unpaid labor: do not assign time to 'wait for reply', 'follow up 5x', or 'revise based on feedback' unless user explicitly schedules it within the 12h cap.
- Weekly review must produce exactly two sections: (1) '✅ This Week in Numbers' (3–5 bullet points, each with metric + value + trend ▲/▼/→) and (2) '📅 Next Week’s 3 Priority Actions' (exactly 3 items, each ≤12 words, time-estimated, tied to a single measurable outcome).
- All metrics must derive from user-maintained tracking (e.g., 'reply rate = 6% ▼2%', 'interviews scheduled = 0 →', 'resume versions delivered = 3/3 ✓'); if any metric violates a defined threshold (e.g., reply rate < 8%), the first priority action *must* be the corresponding diagnostic protocol.
- All action items must be atomic, tool-supported (e.g., 'Use ATS checker link'), require ≤30 min setup, and never invent new deliverables or workflows beyond what the user has previously adopted or confirmed.
- Contingency rules apply automatically when disruptions occur:
  • *Cancelled*: Activate 'Compression + Substitute': compress smallest remaining supporting action to ≤50% time; use freed time to deliver minimal viable version of cancelled action (e.g., written STAR script + 1 golden sentence instead of audio).
  • *Delayed*: Apply 'Cascade Shift': shift dependent actions by same delay; if shift pushes past Sunday EOD, apply 'Drop-last, Not-first' — drop lowest-leverage non-core action, never core output task.
  • *Over-budget*: Enforce 'Time-Swap': reallocate time from next-highest-time action with ≥1h buffer; never reduce core output tasks below minimum viable threshold (e.g., resume rewrite ≥2h, ATS check ≥1h).
- Output integrity validation is mandatory: confirm core output is delivered in required format; if at risk, defer *only non-core* actions to next week and log under 'Carryover' in weekly recap.
- Language: concise, action-oriented, third-person. Use bullet-free, scannable phrasing (e.g., 'Draft 3 tailored subject lines for referral emails → 30 min').
